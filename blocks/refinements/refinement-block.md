## ðŸ”„ Refinement
> ðŸ’¡ *Define exact properties and behaviours of all components to be created or updated. Follow the 5-layer approach: Actors & Components, Activities, Activity Flows, Properties, and Behaviours. Each layer builds upon the previous one.*

[Define properties and behaviours following the refinement workflow]

```
<example>
### [[component-name]]

#### Properties
- [Identity properties: unique identifiers, names]
- [Configuration properties: settings, options, preferences]
- [State properties: status, current values, runtime data]

#### Behaviours
- UI/UX: [How it looks and feels]
- Rules & Limits: [Validation rules, constraints, boundaries]
- Data & Analytics: [What data is tracked, measured]
- Security: [Access control, permissions]
- Performance: [Speed requirements, optimization needs]
</example>
```
