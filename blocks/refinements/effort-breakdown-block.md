## ⏱️ Effort Breakdown & Estimates
> 💡 *We estimate the ideal and most likely outcome for design, refinement, front-end, back-end and operational work. QA is calculated as 25% of core work, while testing is calculated as 15% of core work. On top of that we add a margin for possible delay, which defaults to 10% of total work, but is increased if we think there is a high risk of unknown problems along the way.*

### Core Work Estimates

| Work Type      | Hours       | Reasoning                                                                         |
|:---------------|:------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Design**     | [ X ]       | [ Explanation of design effort needed, or 0 if none ]                             |
| **Refinement** | [ X ]       | [ Effort needed for planning, detailing requirements, and refining the approach ] |
| **Front-end**  | [ X ]       | [ Front-end development tasks (UI implementation, state management, etc.) ]       |
| **Backend**    | [ X ]       | [ Backend development tasks (API endpoints, database changes, logic, etc.) ]      |
| **Operations** | [ X ]       | [ DevOps, deployment, configuration tasks ]                                       |
| **Core Total** | **[ Sum ]** |                                                                                   |


### QA, Testing & Delay Margin

| Work Type        | Hours | Percentage | Reasoning                                                  |
|:-----------------|:------|:-----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **QA**           | [ X ] | **25%**    | [ 25% of core work total for quality assurance ]           |
| **Testing**      | [ X ] | **15%**    | [ 15% of core work total for testing effort ]              |
| **Delay Margin** | [ X ] | **10%+**   | [ 10% minimum, increase for high-risk/unknown complexity ] |
