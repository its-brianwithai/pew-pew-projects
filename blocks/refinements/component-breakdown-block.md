## 🧩 Component Breakdown
> 💡 *Detailed breakdown of high-level goals into concrete scenarios showing step-by-step actor interactions and responsible teams.*

[Create a breakdown for each major component or goal using this structure]

```
<example>
### [Component/Goal Name]
> [Brief description of what this component/goal achieves]

**Scenario 1: [Scenario Name]**
- **Actor:** [[actor-name]]
- **Steps:**

  2. [[system]] responds with [[response]]
  3. [[actor]] completes [[final-action]]
- **Responsible Team:** [[team-name]]
- **Dependencies:** [[dependency-1]], [[dependency-2]]

**Scenario 2: [Another Scenario Name]**
- **Actor:** [[another-actor]]
- **Steps:**
  1. Step description with [[actor]] and [[action]]
  2. Another step with [[component]] interaction
  3. Final step with [[outcome]]
