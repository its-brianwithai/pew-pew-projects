## 🎬 Activities (Who or what does what?)
> 💡 *Actions that an Actor or Component performs (examples include Create List, Delete Item, Sync Data, and they must always contain a verb + action). What can each actor do? · What should happen automatically? · What needs user input? · What happens periodically? · What triggers other activities? · What needs to be logged? · What needs to be measured? · What needs authorization?*
