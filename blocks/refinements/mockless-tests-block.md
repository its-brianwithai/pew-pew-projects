## ðŸ§ª Mockless Tests
> ðŸ’¡ *Components, flows, and code that would benefit from testing. No mocks allowed - test with real implementations or isolated business logic.*

[Describe testing needs for each category using wikilinks to reference components]

```
<example>
- **Unit Tests:** [List isolated business logic to test without mocks (e.g., [[validation-service]], [[calculation-helper]], [[data-transformer]])]
- **Widget/Component Tests:** [List UI components to test (e.g., [[login-form]] rendering, [[user-list]] interactions, [[profile-card]] states)]
- **Integration Tests:** [List integrated flows with real services (e.g., [[auth-flow]] with real auth service, [[data-sync]] between [[component-a]] and [[component-b]])]
- **E2E Tests:** [List complete user journeys (e.g., Full [[signup-flow]], complete [[checkout-process]])]
