> ðŸ’¡ What we want to guarantee with the tests written for this story.*.

When 100% of the tests pass, we should be able to guarantee that:

```
<example>
- [ ] [Example: something we want to guarantee with the tests written for this story e.g. user can log in with valid credentials]
- [ ] [Add more guarantees as needed]
- [ ] [...]
</example>
```
