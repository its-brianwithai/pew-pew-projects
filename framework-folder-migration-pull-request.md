## 🎯 Implementation Overview
> 💡 *High-level description of what was implemented and why*

This implementation migrates the Pew Pew PLX framework from using a hidden `.pew` folder in the repository to a public `pew` folder. This change improves discoverability and follows conventions where framework source code is public while user configurations remain hidden.

The key architectural change is the introduction of a three-stage folder system:
1. **Repository**: `pew/` (public, framework source)
2. **User Local**: `.pew/` (hidden, user's working directory) 
3. **Processing**: `.pew-temp-sync/` (temporary, for safe WikiLink processing)
4. **Claude Code**: `.claude/` (hidden, final synced destination)

This ensures that:
- Framework code is visible and accessible in the repository
- Users continue to work in their familiar hidden `.pew` folder
- WikiLink processing happens in an isolated temporary folder
- Claude Code receives properly processed files in `.claude`

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details
> 💡 *Detailed breakdown of all technical changes made*

### Init System (`lib/init.js`)

#### What Changed
Modified the initialization system to automatically convert the public `pew` folder from the repository to the hidden `.pew` folder in user projects.

#### Code Examples
```javascript
// Before
async function moveFiles(src, dest, ignoredFiles = []) {
  // Simple file copying logic
  const srcPath = join(src, entry.name);
  const destPath = join(dest, entry.name);
  // ...
}

// After  
async function moveFiles(src, dest, ignoredFiles = []) {
  const srcPath = join(src, entry.name);
  let destPath = join(dest, entry.name);
  
  // Special handling: rename 'pew' to '.pew' when copying to local
  if (entry.name === 'pew' && entry.isDirectory()) {
    destPath = join(dest, '.pew');
    
    // Merge with existing .pew if it exists
    try {
      await fs.access(destPath);
      console.log(chalk.yellow('📁 Merging with existing .pew folder...'));
      await mergeDirectories(srcPath, destPath);
      continue;
    } catch (e) {
      // .pew doesn't exist, proceed with normal copy
    }
  }
  // ...
}

// New merge function
async function mergeDirectories(src, dest) {
  const entries = await fs.readdir(src, { withFileTypes: true });
  
  for (const entry of entries) {
    const srcPath = join(src, entry.name);
    const destPath = join(dest, entry.name);
    
    if (entry.isDirectory()) {
      await fs.mkdir(destPath, { recursive: true });
      await mergeDirectories(srcPath, destPath);
    } else {
      // Overwrite framework files, preserve user files not in framework
      await fs.copyFile(srcPath, destPath);
    }
  }
}
```

#### File References
- [`lib/init.js:113-152`](lib/init.js#L113) - Main conversion logic
- [`lib/init.js:137-152`](lib/init.js#L137) - Merge directories function

#### Reasoning
This approach was chosen because:
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing installations with `.pew` folders continue to work
- **Merge capability**: Framework updates don't overwrite user customizations
- **Transparent conversion**: Users don't need to change their workflow
- **Clean separation**: Repository structure differs from user structure intentionally

**Feedback:**

### Sync Script System (`.pew/scripts/claude-code/`)

#### What Changed
All sync scripts were updated to use a temporary `.pew-temp-sync` folder for processing and to auto-create missing directories instead of failing.

#### Code Examples
```bash
# Before (sync-claude-code.sh)
TEMP_DIR="/tmp/claude-sync-$$"

# After
TEMP_DIR="$PROJECT_ROOT/.pew-temp-sync"

# Copy entire .pew folder to temp directory for safe processing
if [ -d "$PROJECT_ROOT/.pew" ]; then
    echo "📂 Copying .pew to temporary sync folder..."
    cp -r "$PROJECT_ROOT/.pew" "$TEMP_DIR/.pew"
else
    echo "⚠️  No .pew directory found, creating empty structure..."
    mkdir -p "$TEMP_DIR/.pew"
fi
```

```bash
# Before (individual sync scripts)
if [ ! -d "$AGENTS_DIR" ]; then
    echo "❌ Error: Agents directory not found at $AGENTS_DIR"
    exit 1
fi

# After
# Create agents directory if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -d "$SOURCE_DIR" ]; then
    echo "📁 Creating agents directory at $SOURCE_DIR"
    mkdir -p "$SOURCE_DIR"
fi
```

#### File References

- [`.pew/scripts/claude-code/sync-claude-code-agents.sh:7-22`](.pew/scripts/claude-code/sync-claude-code-agents.sh#L7) - Agent sync updates
- All other sync scripts follow the same pattern

#### Reasoning
- **Safe processing**: WikiLinks are processed in temp folder without corrupting originals
- **Auto-creation**: Missing directories no longer cause sync failures
- **Atomic operations**: All processing happens in temp before moving to final location
- **Clean workspace**: Temp folder is always cleaned up after sync

**Feedback:**

### Makefile Updates

#### What Changed
Updated all script paths from `.pew/scripts` to `pew/scripts` and modified the pull functionality to handle `pew` → `.pew` conversion.

#### Code Examples
```makefile
# Before
@./.pew/scripts/claude-code/sync-claude-code.sh

# After
@./pew/scripts/claude-code/sync-claude-code.sh
```

```makefile
# New pull logic
if [ -d pew ] && [ ! -d .pew ]; then \
    echo "📂 Converting pew to .pew..."; \
    if [ -d ../.pew ]; then \
        echo "📁 Merging with existing .pew folder..."; \
        cp -R pew/* ../.pew/ 2>/dev/null || true; \
        cp -R pew/.[^.]* ../.pew/ 2>/dev/null || true; \
    else \
        cp -R pew ../.pew; \
    fi; \
    rm -rf pew; \
fi; \
```

#### File References
- [`Makefile:8-11`](Makefile#L8) - Sync command paths
- [`Makefile:52-62`](Makefile#L52) - Pull conversion logic
- [`Makefile:78`](Makefile#L78) - Watch command path

#### Reasoning
- **Consistency**: All paths now reference the public `pew` folder in the repository
- **Smart conversion**: Pull command automatically handles the folder conversion
- **Preserve structure**: Repository and user structures are kept intentionally different

**Feedback:**

### Framework Content Migration (`pew/`)

#### What Changed
Entire framework structure (318 files) moved from `.pew/` to `pew/`:
- 39 agents across multiple categories (claude, dev, discovery, meta, plan, review)
- 94 prompts for various commands
- 30 templates (outputs)
- 104 template blocks
- 9 instructions
- 5 workflows
- Scripts, context, and other supporting files

#### File References
The framework now includes:
- [`pew/agents/`](pew/agents/) - All AI agents organized by category
- [`pew/prompts/`](pew/prompts/) - Command prompts
- [`pew/templates/`](pew/templates/) - Document templates and blocks
- [`pew/instructions/`](pew/instructions/) - Conventions and rules
- [`pew/workflows/`](pew/workflows/) - Multi-step processes
- [`pew/scripts/`](pew/scripts/) - Sync and utility scripts
- [`pew/context/`](pew/context/) - Project information
- [`pew/modes/`](pew/modes/) - Operational modes
- [`pew/output-formats/`](pew/output-formats/) - Response formats

#### Reasoning
- **Visibility**: Framework code is now discoverable in the repository
- **Convention**: Follows standard practice of public source, private config
- **Maintenance**: Easier to track changes and contributions to framework

## 💼 Business Logic Changes
> 💡 *Document any changes to business rules or domain logic*

### Framework Distribution Model
- **Previous Behaviour:** Framework distributed with hidden `.pew` folder
- **New Behaviour:** Framework distributed with public `pew` folder, converted to `.pew` locally
- **Impact:** Users see no change in their workflow, but contributors can now easily see framework structure
- **Example:** Running `plx init` now converts `pew/` to `.pew/` automatically

### Sync Processing Model
- **Previous Behaviour:** WikiLinks processed directly in `.pew` folder
- **New Behaviour:** WikiLinks processed in isolated `.pew-temp-sync` folder
- **Impact:** No risk of corrupting original files during sync
- **Example:** Failed sync no longer leaves `.pew` folder in inconsistent state
