name: platform-template
description: Use this template to indicate certain platforms within this project. It's important that we don't put specific project details in this template, so we can also use this platform description elsewhere. We need to focus purely on what the platform does, what the possibilities are, and how you get access to the platform.
instructions: Make sure that when you implement this template, you don't include these instructions or any other front matter from this template in your work. Output should always and only be the markdown part outside of the front matter. Never include any tags like <example>, <commentary>, or similar tags - these serve only to increase clarity about implementation. Always use single [ ] brackets to indicate instructions the implementer should follow. When referencing other documents from this project, use wikilinks format [[filename-example-wiki-link]] to reference them. Do not include the file extension or path.
