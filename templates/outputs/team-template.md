description: Use this template to describe a team within this project that can carry out certain activities as creators of this project. So, these aren't the users of this project, but the people actively working on it.
instructions: Make sure that when you implement this template, you don't include these instructions or any other front matter from this template in your work. Output should always and only be the markdown part outside of the front matter.
