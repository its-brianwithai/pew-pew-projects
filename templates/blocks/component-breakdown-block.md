## ðŸ§© Component Breakdown
> ðŸ’¡ *High-level breakdown of component behaviors. Only document what the user has explicitly specified - never invent or assume behaviors not mentioned in the requirements.*

### Behaviours
[Document how the component should operate based on the stated requirements. Consider validation rules, data handling, security needs, performance constraints, and error scenarios - but only include those actually relevant to this specific component.]

### Critical Paths
**What Must Always Work:** [Operations that cannot fail]  
**What Could Go Wrong:** [Potential failure points]  
**What Should Never Happen:** [Unacceptable states or behaviors]

### Test Considerations
[Based on the documented behaviors, identify key scenarios that should be validated]
