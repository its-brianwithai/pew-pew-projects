# ✂️ Simplify to MVP: Strip Issues to Essential Must-Haves

Transform bloated issues into focused MVP requirements by ruthlessly cutting non-essential features and identifying invented complexity.

---

## 🎯 End Goal

Successfully simplify an issue or requirement document to:
- Include ONLY features essential for first working version
- Remove all nice-to-haves, optimizations, and future considerations  
- Eliminate any requirements not explicitly requested by stakeholders
- Focus on core functionality that delivers immediate value
- Reduce implementation complexity and time to ship
- Create clear, actionable MVP scope

## 📋 Request

Systematically simplify requirements by:
1. Loading and analyzing the current issue/requirements
2. Identifying all non-MVP features to remove
3. Finding requirements that were never explicitly asked for
4. Determining the absolute minimum for a working solution
5. Rewriting the simplified MVP version
6. Justifying each removal with clear rationale

### Deliverables
- List of features marked as non-MVP with reasons
- List of made-up requirements that weren't requested
- Simplified MVP version of the issue
- Clear justification for each cut
- Recommendation on implementation approach

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Every feature evaluated for MVP necessity
- [ ] All invented requirements identified
- [ ] Simplified version is immediately actionable
- [ ] Core user value is preserved
- [ ] Implementation complexity significantly reduced
- [ ] No premature optimizations remain

## 🔄 Workflow

### Step 1: Load and Analyze Current Requirements
**Deliverable:** Complete understanding of current scope
**Acceptance Criteria:** All features and requirements documented

- Load the issue or requirements document
- List every single feature, requirement, and capability
- Note which features reference other features as dependencies
- Identify the core problem being solved

### Step 2: Classify Each Requirement
**Deliverable:** MoSCoW classification of all requirements
**Acceptance Criteria:** Every item categorized with justification

Apply MoSCoW method to each requirement:
- **Must Have**: System won't work without it
- **Should Have**: Important but system functions without it
- **Could Have**: Nice to have if time permits
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope for MVP

Classification questions:
- Does the core feature work without this?
- Was this explicitly requested?
- Is this solving a problem that exists now?
- Can users work around this limitation?

### Step 3: Identify Made-Up Requirements
**Deliverable:** List of invented features
**Acceptance Criteria:** Source validation for each requirement

Check each requirement against original request:
- Was this explicitly mentioned?
- Is this implied by the request?
- Is this a developer assumption?
- Is this "best practice" addition?
- Is this future-proofing?

Common made-up requirements:
- Analytics and tracking
- Complex error handling
- Settings and preferences
- Localization/internationalization
- Performance optimizations
- Security beyond basics
- Admin interfaces
- Reporting features

### Step 4: Determine True MVP
**Deliverable:** Absolute minimum feature set
**Acceptance Criteria:** Core problem solved with least effort

Answer for each Must Have:
- Can we solve the problem without this?
- Can we hardcode instead of configure?
- Can we do this manually first?
- Can the system handle this?
- Can we use existing solutions?

MVP principles:
- One happy path only
- No edge case handling (unless critical)
- No optimizations
- No nice error messages
- Basic functionality only
- System defaults where possible

### Step 5: Evaluate Implementation Approach
**Deliverable:** Recommended technical approach
**Acceptance Criteria:** Simplest scalable solution identified

Consider implementation options:
- Client-side vs server-side
- Event-driven vs polling
- Real-time vs batch
- Push vs pull
- Automated vs manual

Choose based on:
- Simplicity of implementation
- Reliability and guaranteed execution
- Future scalability (but don't build for it)
- Existing infrastructure
- Single source of truth

### Step 6: Rewrite Simplified Issue
**Deliverable:** Clean MVP version of requirements
**Acceptance Criteria:** Focused, actionable specification

Create new version with:
- Only Must Have requirements
- Clear, simple language
- No future considerations
- No "nice to have" mentions
- No complex architectures
- Basic acceptance criteria
- Minimal technical specification

## 📏 Instructions

### WHEN analyzing requirements
**Best Practices:**
- Be skeptical of every feature
- Question all assumptions
- Look for hidden complexity
- Identify scope creep patterns

**Red Flags:**
- "While we're at it..."
- "It would be nice if..."
- "For future consideration..."
- "Best practice suggests..."
- "We might need..."
- "To be safe..."

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS question necessity
- NEVER accept features without justification
- MUST validate against original request

### WHEN classifying features
**Must Have Criteria:**
- Core functionality breaks without it
- Explicitly requested by stakeholder
- No workaround exists
- Legal/compliance requirement

**Should Remove:**
- Analytics/tracking
- Deep linking/navigation
- Settings/preferences
- Optimizations
- Complex error handling
- Future-proofing

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS err on side of removal
- MUST justify keeping, not removing
- NEVER keep "just in case"

### WHEN identifying made-up requirements
**Common Patterns:**
- Developer additions for "completeness"
- Best practices not requested
- Infrastructure for scale not needed
- Features from similar projects
- Preventive measures for unlikely scenarios

**Validation Questions:**
- "Where did this requirement come from?"
- "Who asked for this specifically?"
- "What breaks without this?"
- "When will this be needed?"

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS trace to source
- MUST distinguish explicit from implied
- NEVER assume stakeholder wants it

### WHEN determining MVP
**Simplification Strategies:**
- Configure → Hardcode
- Automate → Manual process
- Real-time → Batch/scheduled
- Custom → Use existing
- Flexible → Fixed
- Multiple options → Single option

**MVP Mindset:**
- Ship something that works
- Get feedback fast
- Iterate based on real usage
- Add complexity only when proven necessary

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS choose simpler option
- MUST solve core problem only
- NEVER build for hypothetical scenarios

### WHEN evaluating implementation
**Scalability vs Simplicity:**
- Choose scalable architecture
- But don't implement scale features
- Event-driven > polling
- Server-side truth > client claims
- Triggers > scheduled checks

**Decision Factors:**
- Reliability over features
- Simplicity over flexibility
- Proven over innovative
- Existing over custom

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS consider maintenance burden
- MUST use existing infrastructure
- NEVER optimize prematurely

### WHEN rewriting requirements
**Structure:**
- Core problem statement
- Minimum requirements list
- Simple acceptance criteria
- Basic technical approach

**Language:**
- Clear and direct
- No hedging or possibilities
- Present tense for requirements
- Concrete, not abstract

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS be specific
- MUST be immediately actionable
- NEVER mention future phases
