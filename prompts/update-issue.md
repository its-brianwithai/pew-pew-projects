# Update Issue

Update an existing issue by refining it through the issue workflow phases.

## Instructions

1. Identify which existing issue needs to be updated (ask the user if unclear)
2. Determine which phase of the workflow the issue is currently in
3. Continue from that phase or revisit earlier phases if requirements have changed
4. Apply the issue workflow to refine and improve the issue documentation
