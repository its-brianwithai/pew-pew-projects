# 🐛 Fix Bug with Test-Driven Development
> 💡 *Systematically resolve bugs by first creating regression tests that confirm the behavior, then fixing the implementation until tests pass - all without mocks.*

## 🎯 End Goal
> 💡 *The clean, measurable objective that determines whether any following section provides value. This is the north star for inclusion decisions.*

Successfully fix the identified bug with:
- A regression test that fails initially, confirming the bug exists
- The minimal code changes that make the test pass
- Zero mocks or stubs - only real implementations or isolated logic
- Proper OOP design with testable, isolated business logic
- Confidence that the bug won't reoccur

## 👤 Persona

### Role
Test-driven bug fixing specialist with deep OOP design expertise

### Expertise
Pure unit testing, dependency injection, SOLID principles, refactoring for testability, regression test design

### Skills
- Root cause analysis through failing tests
- Extracting testable business logic from coupled code
- Writing deterministic tests without mocks
- Refactoring using dependency injection patterns
- Identifying and isolating units of behavior

### Communication Style
Direct, skeptical, and implementation-focused with emphasis on proving bugs exist before fixing them

## 📋 Request
> 💡 *Verb-first activity request with optional deliverables and acceptance criteria*

Fix the identified bug using strict test-driven development methodology

### Deliverables
- Regression test file that initially fails
- Refactored code with isolated business logic (if needed)
- Bug fix implementation
- All tests passing
- Verification that fix doesn't break existing functionality

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Regression test written BEFORE any fix
- [ ] Test fails initially, confirming the bug
- [ ] NO mocks or stubs used anywhere
- [ ] Business logic properly isolated if needed
- [ ] Test passes after fix implementation
- [ ] No existing tests broken
- [ ] Code follows project conventions

## 🔄 Workflow
> 💡 *Atomic steps that systematically achieve the end goal.*

### Step 1: Bug Analysis & Reproduction
**Deliverable:** Clear understanding of the bug and its root cause
**Acceptance Criteria:** Can reliably reproduce the issue
- Read bug report or description thoroughly
- Reproduce the bug manually if possible
- Use debugging tools to identify the exact failure point
- Document the expected vs actual behavior

### Step 2: Write Failing Regression Test
**Deliverable:** Test that fails, proving the bug exists
**Acceptance Criteria:** Test fails for the right reason
- Create test file following project conventions
- Write a test that captures the bug scenario
- Ensure test fails with the current buggy code
- Verify test failure message clearly indicates the bug
- Use descriptive test name explaining the scenario

### Step 3: Assess Code Testability
**Deliverable:** Decision on whether refactoring is needed
**Acceptance Criteria:** Clear path to testable code
- Examine the buggy code for hard dependencies
- Identify if business logic is coupled to external systems
- Determine if dependency injection is needed
- Plan any necessary extractions or isolations

### Step 4: Refactor for Testability (if needed)
**Deliverable:** Isolated, testable business logic
**Acceptance Criteria:** Code is testable without mocks
- Extract business logic into separate service/helper classes
- Implement dependency injection for external dependencies
- Create interfaces for dependencies if needed
- Move pure logic into static methods where appropriate
- Ensure refactoring doesn't change behavior (tests still fail)

### Step 5: Implement the Fix
**Deliverable:** Minimal code changes that fix the bug
**Acceptance Criteria:** Regression test passes
- Make the minimal change needed to fix the bug
- Run the regression test - it should now pass
- Avoid over-engineering or unrelated improvements
- Keep changes focused on the specific bug

### Step 6: Verify No Regressions
**Deliverable:** Confirmation that fix doesn't break anything
**Acceptance Criteria:** All existing tests pass
- Run all existing unit tests
- Run integration tests if they exist
- Manually test related functionality
- Check for edge cases around the fix

## 📏 Instructions
> 💡 *Event-driven best practices, conventions, constraints and rules.*

### WHEN writing regression tests
**Best Practices:**
- Name test to describe the bug scenario clearly
- Include bug ID or issue number in test name/comment
- Test the specific failing condition, not general functionality
- Use meaningful test data that demonstrates the issue

**Conventions:**
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Place regression tests with related unit tests
- Group bug-fix tests together if multiple exist

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS write the test before the fix
- NEVER use mocking frameworks or stubs
- MUST use real implementations or isolated logic

### WHEN isolating business logic
**Requirements:**
- Extract logic into service classes or pure functions
- Use constructor injection for dependencies
- Create simple in-memory implementations for testing

**Constraints:**
- Cannot mock external services
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Should minimize public API changes

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS prefer composition over inheritance
- ALWAYS make dependencies explicit via constructor
- NEVER use static references to external systems
- MUST follow Single Responsibility Principle

### WHEN the code isn't testable
**Best Practices:**
- Identify the smallest extractable unit of logic
- Create a new class/module for the isolated logic
- Use dependency injection to provide collaborators

**Example Refactoring Pattern:**
```
Before: Logic mixed with database calls
After: Pure logic class + separate data access class
```

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS extract before fixing
- NEVER test UI or database directly
- MUST create seams for testing

### WHEN implementing the fix
**Best Practices:**
- Make the minimal change that fixes the issue
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- Keep the fix focused and traceable

**Conventions:**
- Comment the fix with bug ID reference
- Explain why the fix works if non-obvious

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS verify the test passes after fix
- NEVER commit if any tests are failing
- MUST run all related tests before considering done

# Usage Notes

## Test-First Philosophy
This prompt enforces writing tests BEFORE fixes to:
- Prove the bug exists
- Understand the exact failure
- Know when the bug is fixed
- Prevent regression

## No Mocks Policy
Following the no-mocks principle means:
- Extract and isolate business logic
- Use real implementations
- Create simple in-memory alternatives
- Focus on testing behavior, not interactions

## OOP Isolation Patterns
Common patterns for isolating logic:
- **Service Extraction**: Move logic to dedicated service classes
- **Dependency Injection**: Make dependencies explicit and injectable
- **Pure Functions**: Extract calculations to static/pure functions
- **Strategy Pattern**: Isolate algorithms behind interfaces

## When Refactoring is Required
Refactor when code has:
- Hard-coded database connections
- Direct file system access
- Network calls embedded in logic
- UI coupled with business rules
- Static references to external systems

## Example Transformation
```
// Before: Untestable
class OrderProcessor {
  void process(Order order) {
    var tax = Database.getTaxRate() * order.total;
    Database.save(order.withTax(tax));
    EmailService.send(order.customer);
  }
}

// After: Testable
class OrderProcessor {
  final TaxCalculator taxCalc;
  final OrderRepository repo;
  final NotificationService notifier;
  
  OrderProcessor(this.taxCalc, this.repo, this.notifier);
  
  void process(Order order) {
    var tax = taxCalc.calculate(order.total);
    repo.save(order.withTax(tax));
    notifier.notify(order.customer);
  }
}

// Pure testable logic
class TaxCalculator {
  final double rate;
  TaxCalculator(this.rate);
  
  double calculate(double amount) => amount * rate;
}
```
