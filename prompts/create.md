## 🔄 Workflow
> 💡 *Atomic steps that systematically achieve the end goal.*

### Step 1: Desire Discovery
**Deliverable:** Clear understanding of what the user wants to DO
**Acceptance Criteria:** Desire mapped to specific action verb and outcome
- Ask: "What do you want to do with this framework?"
- Identify the core action verb (create, identify, refine, update, generate, etc.)
- Map to concrete examples:
  - "identify actors" → need identification workflow + actor template
  - "refine issues" → need refinement process + issue conventions
  - "create feature" → need feature workflow + templates
- Document the transformation from desire to required components

### Step 2: Component Analysis
**Deliverable:** Complete component breakdown following prompt-template structure
**Acceptance Criteria:** Each component evaluated for contribution to end goal
- Analyze which components are needed:
  - **End Goal**: Always required - the measurable success criterion
  - **Persona**: Include if specialized expertise improves outcome
  - **Request**: Always required - the verb-first action
  - **Workflow**: Include if multi-step process needed
  - **Instructions**: Include if conventions/rules prevent failure
  - **Output Format**: Include if specific structure required
- Document why each component is included/excluded

### Step 3: Search Existing Artifacts
**Deliverable:** List of reusable existing components
**Acceptance Criteria:** All relevant artifacts identified and evaluated
- Search patterns by artifact type:
  - `agents/**/*[topic]*.md` for existing expertise
  - `workflows/*[process]*.md` for established processes
  - `prompts/*[verb]*.md` for similar actions
  - `templates/**/*[type]*.md` for output formats
  - `instructions/*[convention]*.md` for rules
  - `modes/*[behavior]*.md` for interaction patterns
  - `personas/*[role]*.md` for character definitions
  - `templates/blocks/*[section]*.md` for content sections
- Document which existing artifacts can be reused via wikilinks

### Step 4: Sharding Strategy Development
**Deliverable:** Plan for extracting reusable components
**Acceptance Criteria:** Maximum reusability achieved
- Identify shareable components:
  - End goals → `goals/[goal-name].md` (if broadly applicable)
  - Personas → Consider agent creation opportunity
  - Workflows → `workflows/[workflow-name]-workflow.md`
  - Instructions → `instructions/[topic]-instructions.md`
  - Output formats → `templates/[format]-template.md`
- Determine agent extraction opportunity:
  - If Persona + Workflow + Instructions align → create agent
  - Agent becomes: `agents/[agent-name].md`
  - Then embed in prompt: `![[agent-name-example-wiki-link]]`

### Step 5: Question-Mode Refinement
**Deliverable:** Refined understanding through systematic questioning
**Acceptance Criteria:** All ambiguities resolved using YES/NO questions
- Activate question-mode for overall desire
- Establish specific, measurable goal first
- Apply the 5 question types systematically:
  - **🔄 Simplify**: Can we combine or reduce complexity?
  - **❓ Clarify**: Are requirements unambiguous?
  - **🔧 Improve**: What enhancements would increase quality?
  - **➕ Expand**: What edge cases or features are missing?
  - **➖ Reduce**: What can be deferred to MVP?
- Use Batch-5 mode for comprehensive coverage (one of each type)
- Document all decisions in refinement log

### Step 6: Artifact Assembly
**Deliverable:** Complete artifact with proper wikilink architecture
**Acceptance Criteria:** Artifact ready for immediate use
- Structure using appropriate template:
  - Prompts → Follow [[prompt-template]] structure
  - Agents → Follow [[agent-template]] structure
  - Workflows → Follow [[workflow-template]] structure
  - Templates → Include YAML frontmatter + markdown body
  - Instructions → Include name, description, actionable content
- Implement wikilink architecture:
  - Standard `[[name-example-wiki-link]]` for references (→ @path after sync)
  - Embedded `![[name-example-wiki-link]]` for content (line replaced during sync)
  - CRITICAL: Embedded wikilinks MUST be on their own line
- Write to appropriate directory with correct naming convention
- DO NOT add "Reference" sections unless the artifact actually uses/embeds that template

### Step 7: Next Steps Generation
**Deliverable:** Actionable suggestions for enhancement
**Acceptance Criteria:** User has clear path forward
- Suggest optimizations:
  - Extract additional shareable components
  - Create specialized agents from components
  - Develop complementary artifacts
  - Apply further refinement
  - Test artifact effectiveness
- Let user choose direction

## 📏 Instructions
> 💡 *Event-driven best practices, conventions, constraints and rules.*

### WHEN discovering user desires
**Best Practices:**
- Start with open-ended discovery of what they want to DO
- Map desires to concrete action verbs
- Consider the full lifecycle of the artifact

**Conventions:**

# Usage Notes

## Complete Artifact Coverage
This prompt understands and can create:
- **Prompts**: Reusable instructions with XML structure
- **Agents**: Specialized sub-agents with focused expertise
- **Templates**: Documentation templates with YAML frontmatter
- **Workflows**: Multi-step orchestrations with agent coordination
- **Context**: Documentation for project elements
- **Instructions**: Convention documents and guidelines
- **Modes**: Operational behaviors (like question-mode)
- **Personas**: Character definitions with attributes
- **Blocks**: Reusable template sections

## Philosophy Implementation
Every creation follows the pattern:
1. Desire → "What do you want to DO?"
2. Decomposition → Break into modular components
3. Sharding → Extract reusable pieces
4. Assembly → Combine via wikilinks
5. Refinement → Apply question-mode throughout

## WikiLink Architecture
- Standard `[[name-example-wiki-link]]` → Becomes @path reference after sync
- Embedded `![[name-example-wiki-link]]` → Content inserted during sync
- Enables maximum reusability and modularity

## Agent Extraction Pattern
When Persona + Workflow + Instructions align:
1. Create agent with combined components
2. Save as `agents/[name].md`
3. Embed in prompts via `![[agent-name-example-wiki-link]]`
4. Agent becomes reusable across artifacts

## Question-Mode Integration
The prompt embeds the full question-mode for systematic refinement:
- 5 question types: Simplify, Clarify, Improve, Expand, Reduce
- 3 operating modes: Single, Batch-5, Document
- YES/NO format for all questions
- Goal-driven questioning approach

## Entity Implementation Rules
All examples and placeholders follow [[entity-implementation-rules]]:
- Single square brackets for instructions: [Do this]
- Double curly with backticks for variables: `{{var}}`
- Examples describe types, not actual content
- Structure is never recreated in examples

## Important Philosophy Notes

**Why No Agent Reference:**
This prompt intentionally does NOT reference an agent at the bottom. Following the create philosophy:
- Components are defined directly in the prompt (Persona, Workflow, Instructions)
- These components COULD be extracted into separate files for reusability
- If Persona + Workflow + Instructions prove valuable together, they COULD become an agent
- But starting with an agent reference violates the decomposition → sharding → assembly pattern

**Proper Evolution Path:**
1. Start with components defined in the prompt (current state)
2. Extract shareable components as they prove useful
3. Create an agent only when components naturally align and need reuse
4. Then future prompts can reference that agent via `![[agent-name-example-wiki-link]]`
