## 🔄 Workflow

### Step 1: Audience & Use Case Analysis
**Deliverable:** Clear understanding of who's learning and what they need
**Acceptance Criteria:** Audience profile and learning objectives defined
- Identify target audience (entrepreneurs, professionals, AI enthusiasts)
- Determine current skill level (never used AI, used ChatGPT few times, regular users)
- Define specific use case (business automation, content creation, etc.)
- Map learning objectives to prompt progression

### Step 2: Content Mapping
**Deliverable:** 8 prompts mapped to learning progression
**Acceptance Criteria:** Each prompt builds on previous, teaches one new concept
- Phase 1: 1 foundation prompt (complete inline)
- Phase 2: 2 pattern recognition prompts
- Phase 3: 2 extraction/modularization prompts
- Phase 4: 2 agent composition prompts
- Phase 5: 1 meta-prompt (generates other prompts)

### Step 3: Exercise Design
**Deliverable:** Practical exercises for each prompt
**Acceptance Criteria:** Immediate application with clear success metrics
- "Try This" exercises for immediate practice
- Expected results for confidence building
- Customization challenges
- Industry-specific variations

### Step 4: Template Implementation
**Deliverable:** Complete promptorial following all conventions
**Acceptance Criteria:** Ready for immediate use
- Apply [[promptorial-template]] structure
- Use proper placeholder formatting: [instruction]
- Include template variables: `{{variable-name}}`
- Add WikiLink references where appropriate

## 📏 Instructions

### WHEN gathering requirements
**Best Practices:**
- Ask for specific audience description
- Understand desired transformation (from → to)
- Identify industry or domain context
- Determine time commitment available

**Questions to Ask:**
```
1. Who is your target audience? (entrepreneurs/professionals/enthusiasts)
2. What's their current AI experience? (none/basic/intermediate)
3. What specific skill do you want to teach? (prompting/automation/content creation)
4. What industry/domain context? (business/education/creative)
5. What's the desired outcome? (save time/improve quality/scale operations)
```

### WHEN designing prompt progression
**Requirements:**
- Start with complete, working prompts
- Add one concept per prompt
- Show pattern emergence naturally
- Build toward component extraction
- End with meta-level mastery

**Progression Pattern:**
```
Prompt 1: Everything inline (establish success)
Prompt 2: Notice first pattern
Prompt 3: See pattern repeat
Prompt 4: Extract to components
Prompt 5: Use WikiLinks
Prompt 6: Compose into agents
Prompt 7: Reuse agents
Prompt 8: Generate new prompts
```

### WHEN creating examples
**Rules:**
- ALWAYS use audience's actual use cases
- ALWAYS show before/after transformations
- NEVER use abstract examples
- MUST include expected outputs

**Example Structure:**
```
<example>
- [Business use case types relevant to audience]
- [Industry-specific scenario types]
- [Common problem types they face]
- [...]
</example>
```

### WHEN implementing template
**Requirements:**
- Follow exact structure from [[promptorial-template]]
- Include all required sections
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Apply entity implementation rules

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Title with emoji and promise
- [ ] End goal clearly stated
- [ ] Core concepts explained
- [ ] 8 progressive prompts
- [ ] Exercises for each phase
- [ ] Component inventory
- [ ] WikiLink mastery section
- [ ] Implementation checklist
