# üî™ Split Into Sessions: Chunk Work for Single-Session Completion

Analyze any task to determine if it can be completed in one focused development session, and intelligently split it into reviewable chunks if not.

---

## üéØ End Goal

Successfully evaluate and potentially split tasks to ensure:
- Each chunk fits within a single 150k token session
- Every session produces a complete, reviewable, shippable piece
- Dependencies are properly sequenced
- No session leaves the codebase broken
- Each chunk provides immediate value
- Total effort is minimized through smart splitting

## üîÑ Workflow

### Step 1: Task Analysis and Token Estimation
**Deliverable:** Complete token consumption breakdown
**Acceptance Criteria:** All major activities estimated

Analyze the task to estimate tokens:

**Exploration/Discovery (High token cost: ~20-40k)**
- File searching and reading
- Understanding existing patterns
- Analyzing dependencies
- Finding similar implementations

**Planning/Design (Medium token cost: ~10-20k)**
- Architecture decisions
- API design
- Data model design
- Workflow planning

**Implementation (Variable cost: 5-30k per component)**
- Simple CRUD: ~5-10k
- Complex business logic: ~15-25k
- UI components: ~10-20k
- API integrations: ~15-30k

**Testing/Verification (Medium cost: ~10-20k)**
- Unit test creation
- Integration testing
- Manual verification steps
- Debugging and fixes

**Documentation/Cleanup (Low cost: ~5-10k)**
- Code comments
- README updates
- PR description
- Commit messages

### Step 2: Single-Session Feasibility Check
**Deliverable:** Go/no-go decision for single session
**Acceptance Criteria:** Clear determination with evidence

Calculate total estimated tokens:
- Sum all activities
- Add 20% buffer for unexpected complexity
- Add 10% for context switching
- Compare to 120k limit (not 150k, keep buffer)

**Fits in one session if:**
- Total < 120k tokens
- No major context switches required
- Single developer can maintain mental model
- All dependencies are available
- No waiting on external systems

**Requires splitting if:**
- Total > 120k tokens
- Multiple distinct domains involved
- Requires different expertise areas
- Natural pause points exist
- Review cycles needed between parts

### Step 3: Identify Natural Split Points
**Deliverable:** Logical boundaries for work division
**Acceptance Criteria:** Clean, independent chunks

Look for natural boundaries:

**Vertical Slices (Preferred)**
- Complete features end-to-end
- Single user story implementation
- One workflow at a time
- Example: "User login" ‚Üí "User registration" ‚Üí "Password reset"

**Horizontal Slices (When necessary)**
- Backend API ‚Üí Frontend UI
- Data layer ‚Üí Business logic ‚Üí Presentation
- Database schema ‚Üí API ‚Üí Client
- Example: "All DTOs" ‚Üí "All APIs" ‚Üí "All Services"

**CRUD Progression**
- Create operations first
- Read operations next
- Update operations
- Delete operations
- Example: "Create household" ‚Üí "View households" ‚Üí "Edit household"

**Entity Progression**
- Core entities first
- Dependent entities next
- Relationships last
- Example: "User model" ‚Üí "Household model" ‚Üí "User-Household relations"

### Step 4: Create Session Plan
**Deliverable:** Ordered session breakdown
**Acceptance Criteria:** Each session is complete and valuable

For each session, define:

```markdown
## Session N: [Clear Session Title]
**Estimated Tokens**: [Amount]
**Dependencies**: Session [X, Y] must be complete
**Duration**: ~[2-4] hours

### Objectives
- [ ] Primary objective
- [ ] Secondary objective
- [ ] Tertiary objective

### Scope
**Included:**
- Specific component/feature
- Exact files to modify
- Clear boundaries

**Excluded:**
- What's deliberately left out
- What's in next session

### Deliverables
- Working [component/feature]
- Tests for [component]
- Documentation updated

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Code compiles/runs
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Feature works end-to-end
- [ ] Can be reviewed independently
- [ ] Can be merged without breaking
```

### Step 5: Define Dependencies and Sequencing
**Deliverable:** Dependency graph and order
**Acceptance Criteria:** No circular dependencies

Map dependencies between sessions:
- Which sessions block others
- Which can be done in parallel
- Critical path identification
- Optional vs required dependencies

```mermaid
graph LR
    S1[Session 1: Data Models] --> S2[Session 2: APIs]
    S1 --> S3[Session 3: Services]
    S2 --> S4[Session 4: UI]
    S3 --> S4
```

### Step 6: Context Preservation Strategy
**Deliverable:** Handoff instructions between sessions
**Acceptance Criteria:** Next session can start cold

Define for each session transition:

**Session Handoff Document**
- What was completed
- What was learned
- Key decisions made
- Known issues/debt
- Next session setup
- Files to review first
- Patterns to follow

**Context Preservation Methods**
- Update CLAUDE.md with patterns discovered
- Create TODO.md for next session
- Leave strategic comments in code
- Update issue with progress
- Create checkpoint commits

## üìè Instructions

### WHEN estimating tokens
**Token Consumption Rules:**
- Reading a file: ~500-2000 tokens depending on size
- Writing new file: ~1000-5000 tokens
- Modifying file: ~2000-8000 tokens (read + write + iterations)
- Understanding pattern: ~5000-10000 tokens (multiple file reads)
- Debugging error: ~5000-20000 tokens (exploration + fixes)

**High Token Activities:**
- Exploring unfamiliar codebase
- Debugging complex issues  
- Refactoring existing code
- Understanding dependencies
- Creating complex algorithms

**Low Token Activities:**
- Following established patterns
- Simple CRUD operations
- Copying similar implementations
- Writing tests for known code
- Documentation updates

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS add 30% buffer to estimates
- NEVER exceed 120k per session
- MUST account for debugging time

### WHEN determining split feasibility
**Single Session Indicators:**
- Clear requirements
- Established patterns exist
- Limited file touches (<10 files)
- Single domain/feature area
- No external dependencies

**Multi-Session Indicators:**
- Vague requirements needing exploration
- Multiple feature areas
- Database + API + UI changes
- New patterns needed
- External service integrations

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS err on side of smaller sessions

- NEVER create sessions that leave broken state

### WHEN identifying split points
**Good Split Points:**
- Between CRUD operations
- Between entities/models
- Between layers (data/logic/UI)
- Between features
- At natural review points

**Bad Split Points:**
- Middle of a feature
- Between tightly coupled components
- Across transaction boundaries
- Where it breaks compilation
- Where tests would fail

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS prefer vertical over horizontal
- MUST maintain working state
- NEVER split atomic operations

### WHEN sequencing sessions
**Sequencing Principles:**
- Dependencies first
- Data models before APIs
- APIs before UI

- Core before auxiliary

**Parallel Opportunities:**
- Independent features
- Different entities

- UI and API (sometimes)

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS identify critical path
- MUST order by dependencies
- NEVER assume parallel work will sync

### WHEN preserving context
**Essential Context:**

- Patterns discovered
- Gotchas encountered  
- Dependencies identified
- Technical debt created

**Preservation Methods:**
- Update project documentation
- Leave breadcrumb comments
- Create handoff notes
- Make checkpoint commits
- Update tracking issues

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS document non-obvious decisions
- MUST enable cold starts
- NEVER assume memory across sessions
