4. Configure reporting (JUnit/HTML)
5. Set up notifications for failures

## Phase 6: Optimization & Maintenance
### Deliverables: Performance metrics and maintenance guide
### Acceptance Criteria: Tests run efficiently and reliably
1. Minimize unnecessary waits
2. Optimize selector strategies
3. Implement smart retry mechanisms
4. Document debugging procedures
5. Create maintenance guidelines

# 📏 Instructions

## Testing Best Practices
- WHEN writing flows ALWAYS validate YAML syntax before execution
- WHEN targeting elements ALWAYS prefer stable selectors: ID > semantics > text
- WHEN handling timing ALWAYS use explicit waits over arbitrary delays
- WHEN testing Flutter ALWAYS add Semantics to custom widgets
- WHEN organizing tests ALWAYS follow one flow = one scenario principle
- WHEN debugging failures ALWAYS inspect view hierarchy first
- WHEN using text selectors ALWAYS use regex for flexibility
- WHEN running tests ALWAYS ensure state cleanup between flows

## Flutter-Specific Rules
- WHEN using semantic identifiers ALWAYS ensure Flutter 3.19+ for stability
- WHEN wrapping widgets ALWAYS use Semantics with clear labels
- WHEN handling internationalization ALWAYS prefer semantic identifiers over text
- WHEN testing forms ALWAYS use semantic identifiers for text fields
- WHEN asserting visibility ALWAYS consider semanticLabel precedence

## Command Usage Patterns
- WHEN tapping elements USE: `tapOn:` with text, id, or index selectors
- WHEN entering text USE: `inputText:` after tapping the field
- WHEN asserting presence USE: `assertVisible:` with appropriate timeout
- WHEN scrolling to element USE: `scrollUntilVisible:` with proper bounds
- WHEN handling popups USE: conditional flows with `runFlow:` and `when:`
- WHEN launching app USE: `launchApp:` with clearState for test isolation
- WHEN taking evidence USE: `takeScreenshot:` at critical points

## CI/CD Configuration
- WHEN setting up Android CI ALWAYS build APK with debug flag
- WHEN setting up iOS CI ALWAYS build for simulator target
- WHEN using Maestro Cloud ALWAYS include API key and project ID
- WHEN organizing execution ALWAYS use tags for different test sets
- WHEN running parallel tests ALWAYS use --shard-split or --shard-all

## Error Handling
- WHEN commands might fail USE: `optional: true` for non-critical steps
- WHEN retrying operations USE: `retry:` with appropriate limits
- WHEN handling conditional UI USE: `runFlow:` with `when:` conditions
- WHEN dealing with animations USE: `waitForAnimationToEnd:`
- WHEN permissions needed USE: `launchApp:` with permissions configuration
