Act as [[git-expert]] and handle this commit operation following all project conventions.

There are two options:
1.  **Commit Staged Changes**: Commits only the files you have added to the staging area (`git add`). This is for precise commits. I will run `git commit`.
2.  **Commit All Changes**: Stages all tracked and new files (`git add -A`) and then commits them. This is to commit all your work at once. I will run `git add -A` and then `git commit`.

If the user provided no preference, perform **Commit All Changes**.
