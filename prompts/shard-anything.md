2. Assessing reusability potential of each component
3. Determining extraction priority and order
4. Creating separate component files
5. Replacing components with appropriate wikilinks

- Extracted component files in correct directories
- Dependency map showing relationships
- Reusability assessment for each component
- Agent creation recommendations (if applicable)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Original functionality preserved
- [ ] Components are self-contained
- [ ] Wikilinks correctly implemented
- [ ] No circular dependencies created
- [ ] Components follow naming conventions
- [ ] Each component has single responsibility
- [ ] Extraction improves maintainability

## üîÑ Workflow
> üí° *Atomic steps that systematically achieve the end goal.*

### Step 1: Component Boundary Analysis
**Deliverable:** Map of potential components
**Acceptance Criteria:** All boundaries identified

Analyze the artifact to identify:
- **Natural Sections**: What's already separated?
- **Repeated Patterns**: What appears multiple places?
- **Logical Units**: What serves single purposes?
- **Standalone Concepts**: What's self-contained?
- **Shared Elements**: What could be reused?

Map components by type:
- Personas (expertise definitions)
- Workflows (process definitions)
- Instructions (rules and conventions)
- Templates (output structures)
- Blocks (content sections)
- Modes (behavioral modifications)

### Step 2: Reusability Assessment
**Deliverable:** Priority list for extraction
**Acceptance Criteria:** Each component evaluated

For each potential component, assess:
- **Current Use**: How many times used now?
- **Potential Use**: Where else could it apply?
- **Generality**: How broadly applicable?
- **Stability**: How likely to change?
- **Value**: What benefit from extraction?

Score components:
- High reuse + High stability = Extract immediately
- High reuse + Low stability = Extract with caution
- Low reuse + High stability = Consider for future
- Low reuse + Low stability = Keep inline

### Step 3: Dependency Mapping
**Deliverable:** Clear dependency graph
**Acceptance Criteria:** No circular dependencies

Map relationships:
1. **Direct Dependencies**: What does each component need?
2. **Inverse Dependencies**: What needs each component?
3. **Circular Risks**: Any potential loops?
4. **Interface Points**: How components connect?

Resolve issues:
- Break circular dependencies
- Minimize coupling
- Define clear interfaces
- Establish dependency direction

### Step 4: Extraction Execution
**Deliverable:** Separate component files
**Acceptance Criteria:** Components properly formatted

For each component to extract:

1. **Create Component File**
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: [component-name]
   description: "[What this component provides]"
   ---
   
   [Component content following appropriate template]
   ```

2. **Choose Correct Directory**
   - Personas ‚Üí `personas/[name].md`
   - Workflows ‚Üí `workflows/[name]-workflow.md`
   - Instructions ‚Üí `instructions/[topic]-instructions.md`
   - Templates ‚Üí `templates/[type]-template.md`
   - Blocks ‚Üí `templates/blocks/[name]-block.md`
   - Output formats ‚Üí `templates/outputs/[format].md`

3. **Ensure Self-Containment**
   - Add necessary context
   - Include required frontmatter
   - Make independently usable

### Step 5: Wikilink Implementation
**Deliverable:** Updated artifact with wikilinks
**Acceptance Criteria:** All links work correctly

Replace extracted components:

**For Reference (read the file):**
```markdown
See [[component-name-example-wiki-link]] for details
```

**For Embedding (insert content):**
```markdown
![[component-name-example-wiki-link]]
```

Critical rules:
- Embedded wikilinks MUST be on own line
- Choose embed vs reference wisely
- Verify all links resolve
- Maintain functionality

### Step 6: Agent Composition Analysis
**Deliverable:** Agent creation recommendations
**Acceptance Criteria:** Opportunities identified

Identify agent opportunities:
- **Aligned Components**: Persona + Workflow + Instructions
- **Focused Expertise**: Single-purpose combinations
- **Reuse Potential**: Would agent be valuable?

If agent opportunity exists:
1. Combine aligned components
2. Create agent file
3. Replace components with agent reference
4. Document agent purpose and use

### Step 7: Validation and Documentation
**Deliverable:** Verified sharded architecture
**Acceptance Criteria:** Everything works correctly

Validate the sharding:
- Test all wikilinks resolve
- Verify functionality preserved
- Check no duplications
- Ensure clear organization
- Document extraction rationale

Create extraction record:
- What was extracted and why
- How components relate
- Usage guidelines
- Evolution suggestions
