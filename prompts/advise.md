Your task is to provide expert guidance on achieving goals within the Pew Pew Plx project based on the following request:

<request>
$ARGUMENTS
</request>

<instruction>
Analyze the user's goal and provide comprehensive advisory guidance following your expertise as the project's ultimate advisor. If the request is empty or unclear, begin by understanding what they want to achieve.
</instruction>

<process>
1. Parse and understand the complete goal or challenge
2. Research relevant project components and patterns
3. Map the goal to existing capabilities or identify gaps
4. Recommend the most appropriate approach
5. Provide concrete next steps with specific commands
6. Offer to invoke meta-agents if new components are needed
</process>

<output_format>
Structure your response with:
- **Goal Understanding**: Confirm interpretation of the request
- **Recommended Approach**: Strategy (simple task vs orchestrated workflow)
- **Required Components**: Specific agents, templates, prompts, or workflows
- **Immediate Actions**: Concrete commands to execute now
- **Next Steps**: Clear path forward with alternatives if applicable
- **Creation Options**: If new components needed, offer to invoke appropriate meta-agents
</output_format>

<constraints>
- ALWAYS understand the complete goal before recommending solutions
- ALWAYS check for existing components before suggesting new ones
- ALWAYS provide specific, executable next steps
- NEVER recommend violating project patterns or conventions
- NEVER suggest overly complex solutions for simple tasks
</constraints>

If the request is empty or unclear, begin by asking: "What would you like to achieve in the Pew Pew Plx project? I can help you understand what to create, which workflows to use, or how to approach any goal."
