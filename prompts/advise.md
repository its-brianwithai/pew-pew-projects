# PLX Framework Advisory Service

<instruction>
Provide comprehensive guidance on using the PLX framework to accomplish the user's goals through systematic understanding, thorough research, and structured clarification.
</instruction>

<context>
The user needs advice on how to use the PLX (Pew-Pew-PLX) framework effectively. This framework includes:
- Specialized agents for different tasks (planning, development, testing, etc.)
- Workflows for systematic feature development (6-phase issue workflow, bug workflow, etc.)
- Commands for creating and updating artifacts (agents, templates, prompts, workflows)
- Question-driven refinement processes for iterative improvement
- Integration capabilities (MCP servers, syncing, version control)
</context>

<process>
## Phase 1: Gain Absolute Clarity
1. Analyze the user's initial request to understand their core objective
2. If the request is unclear or ambiguous, ask ONE focused question at a time
3. Continue clarifying until you have 100% understanding of:
   - What they want to accomplish
   - Why they want to accomplish it
   - What their current context is
   - What constraints or requirements they have

## Phase 2: Comprehensive PLX Research
1. **DO NOT STOP AT 2-3 FILES** - Read ALL relevant PLX documentation:
   - All `/plx:*` commands in `.claude/commands/plx/`
   - Related workflows in `workflows/`
   - Relevant agents in `agents/`
   - Associated prompts in `prompts/`
   - Templates in `templates/`
   - Any feedback or improvement documents
   
2. For each relevant component, understand:
   - Its purpose and capabilities
   - How it integrates with other components
   - When and how to use it effectively
   - Available options and flexibility
   
3. Map the user's needs to PLX capabilities:
   - Identify which workflows apply
   - Determine which agents to leverage
   - Find relevant commands and prompts
   - Consider integration points

## Phase 3: Activate Question Mode
1. Execute @prompts/create-questions-document.md to create a structured questions document
2. Use the filename pattern: `plx-advice-[topic]-questions.md` in the `drafts/` folder
3. Structure questions to cover:
   - ðŸ”§ **Improve**: How to enhance their current approach
   - âž• **Add**: What PLX features they should incorporate
   - âž– **Remove**: What complications to eliminate
   - ðŸš« **Exclude**: What approaches to avoid
4. Focus on YES/NO questions for clarity
5. Include sections for:
   - Current workflow understanding
   - Desired outcomes
   - Technical constraints
   - Team/project context
   - Success criteria

## Phase 4: Process and Synthesize
1. Wait for user to complete questions and signal "done"
2. Execute @prompts/process-answers.md to analyze responses
3. Synthesize findings into comprehensive advice
</process>

<output_format>
After processing the questions, provide:

## ðŸ“‹ Executive Summary
Brief overview of the recommended PLX approach

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended PLX Strategy
### Primary Workflow
- Which workflow to use and why
- Entry points and execution modes
- Expected outcomes

### Key Commands
- Specific `/plx:` commands to use
- Proper sequencing and parameters
- Integration considerations

### Supporting Components
- Agents to leverage
- Templates to follow
- Prompts to utilize

## ðŸ”„ Step-by-Step Implementation
1. [First concrete action with specific PLX command]
2. [Next step with expected output]
3. [Continue through complete process]

## âš¡ Pro Tips
- Shortcuts and optimizations
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Advanced techniques for their use case

## ðŸ“š Relevant Resources
- Specific PLX documentation to review
- Example implementations
- Related workflows or patterns
</output_format>

<constraints>
- ALWAYS gain complete clarity before advising
- ALWAYS read ALL relevant PLX files - no shortcuts
- ALWAYS use questions document for systematic understanding
- ALWAYS provide actionable, specific PLX commands
- ALWAYS explain the why behind recommendations
- NEVER assume understanding - verify through questions
- NEVER skip the research phase
- NEVER provide generic advice - be specific to their needs
</constraints>

<thinking>
The user needs help with PLX but hasn't specified what exactly. I should:
1. First understand what they're trying to accomplish
2. Then thoroughly research ALL relevant PLX components (not just a few files)
3. Create a questions document to gain 1000% clarity
4. Finally provide specific, actionable advice on using PLX effectively
</thinking>

Begin by understanding the user's specific needs and goals with the PLX framework.
