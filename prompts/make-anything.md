## 🔄 Workflow
> 💡 *Atomic steps that systematically achieve the end goal.*

### Step 1: Source Analysis
**Deliverable:** Complete understanding of input material
**Acceptance Criteria:** Intent and content mapped

Analyze the source to identify:
- **Content Type**: What kind of input is this?
  - Raw text or notes
  - Existing artifact
  - Conversation or discussion
  - Requirements or specifications
  - Ideas or concepts
- **Core Intent**: What's the underlying purpose?
- **Hidden Structure**: What organization exists?
- **Key Concepts**: What are the main elements?
- **Relationships**: How do elements connect?

### Step 2: Target Determination
**Deliverable:** Optimal artifact type selected
**Acceptance Criteria:** Target matches content needs

Determine best artifact type:
- **Prompt**: For reusable instructions or requests
- **Agent**: For specialized expertise or roles
- **Template**: For structured documentation
- **Workflow**: For multi-step processes
- **Context**: For system documentation
- **Instructions**: For guidelines and conventions
- **Issue**: For actionable work items
- **Mode**: For behavioral modifications

Consider:
- What would best express this content?
- What would make it most useful?
- What type serves the intent?

### Step 3: Component Extraction
**Deliverable:** Components identified in source
**Acceptance Criteria:** All value captured

Extract from source:
- **Goals**: What outcomes are described?
- **Actors**: Who/what is involved?
- **Actions**: What happens or should happen?
- **Rules**: What constraints exist?
- **Patterns**: What repeats or generalizes?
- **Examples**: What illustrates concepts?
- **Relationships**: What connects to what?

Map to target components:
- Goals → End Goal section
- Actors → Persona or Actor Flow
- Actions → Workflow or Request
- Rules → Instructions or Criteria
- Patterns → Templates or Instructions
- Examples → Output Format examples

### Step 4: Structure Synthesis
**Deliverable:** Content organized in target structure
**Acceptance Criteria:** Follows template exactly

Transform extracted components:
1. **Create Framework**
   - Use appropriate template
   - Set up all required sections
   - Add proper frontmatter

2. **Populate Sections**
   - Place extracted content appropriately
   - Enhance clarity and specificity
   - Add missing but implied elements

3. **Connect Components**
   - Establish relationships
   - Add wikilinks where beneficial
   - Ensure logical flow

### Step 5: Enhancement Application
**Deliverable:** Improved and completed artifact
**Acceptance Criteria:** Adds value beyond source

Enhance the transformation:
- **Fill Gaps**: Add implied but missing elements
- **Clarify Ambiguity**: Make vague concepts specific
- **Add Structure**: Organize loose content
- **Improve Language**: Professional, clear expression
- **Add Examples**: Illustrate abstract concepts
- **Include Criteria**: Make success measurable

### Step 6: Modularization
**Deliverable:** Reusable components identified
**Acceptance Criteria:** Components are shareable

Identify extraction opportunities:
- Repeated patterns → Blocks or templates
- Specialized knowledge → Personas
- Multi-step processes → Workflows
- Rules and conventions → Instructions
- Standard formats → Output templates

Determine if extraction is beneficial:
- Will this be reused?
- Does it stand alone?
- Would linking improve maintainability?

### Step 7: Ecosystem Integration
**Deliverable:** Artifact connected to project
**Acceptance Criteria:** Fits naturally in system

Connect to existing project:
- Link to related artifacts
- Suggest complementary pieces
- Identify dependencies
- Note integration points
- Propose companion artifacts

## 📏 Instructions
> 💡 *Event-driven best practices, conventions, constraints and rules.*

### WHEN analyzing source material
**Best Practices:**
- Look for implicit structure
- Identify unstated assumptions
- Note emotional or business context

**Techniques:**
- Read multiple times for different aspects
- Map concepts before details
- Identify the "why" behind content

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS preserve core intent
- NEVER lose valuable information
- MUST capture relationships

### WHEN selecting target type
**Best Practices:**
- Match type to predominant pattern
- Consider future use cases

- "First, then" → Workflow steps
- "Always/never" → Rules
- Examples → Output formats

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS maintain meaning
- MUST categorize correctly
- NEVER mix component types

### WHEN synthesizing structure
**Requirements:**
- Follow target template exactly
- Include all required sections
- Maintain logical flow

**Enhancement Guidelines:**
- Vague → Specific
