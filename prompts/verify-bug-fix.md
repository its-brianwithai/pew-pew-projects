Act as [[bug-verifier-agent]].

Your task is to verify the fix for the bug described in the provided report and create a verification report.

1.  Review the bug report and the implementation plan.

3.  Execute the plan.
4.  Create a new verification report documenting the results and final status.
</process>

You will be provided with the path to the bug report. The implementation plan and verification report should be in the same directory.

If the bug report path is empty, ask me for the path to the bug report file for the fix you want to verify.
