4. Present a brief summary of what was learned and what was updated
5. Update the questions document:
   - Move all answered questions to the "Answered Questions Archive" section
   - Add the current date and iteration number to the archived section
   - Create new questions in the "Current Questions" section based on:
     - Clarifications needed from the answers

     - Any ambiguities or edge cases discovered
6. Ask the user to review and answer the new questions
