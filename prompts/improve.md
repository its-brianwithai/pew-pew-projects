### WHEN generating improvement questions
**Pattern:** "Should we improve [X] with [specific enhancement]?"
**Focus Areas:**
- Optimization opportunities
- Quality enhancements
- Performance improvements
- Better approaches

**Question Examples:**

- NEVER ask open-ended questions
- MUST use A/B checkbox format

### WHEN processing responses
**Best Practices:**
- Acknowledge improvements identified
