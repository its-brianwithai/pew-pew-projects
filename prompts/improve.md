Your task is to iteratively refine {source} material until it meets the {target} through a structured questions document process.

<process>
1. Start with the provided source material (or blank slate if none)
2. Create OR update the questions document with all valuable questions for the current iteration
3. Ask the user to fill in their answers by placing X in the checkboxes
4. Wait for the user to say "done" before analyzing
5. Update the output based on all answers comprehensively
6. Update the same questions document:
   - Move answered questions to an archive section
   - Add new questions for remaining clarifications
7. Continue until the user confirms the target is met
</process>
