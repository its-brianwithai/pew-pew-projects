# 🔫 Pew Pew 💨 Plx 🙏

AI - project management - context engineering - with large collection - prompts, agents & templates - syncing with Claude Code.

## 🧠 Folders & Concepts

### 💬 Prompting

- `agents/`: AI (sub-)agents for different tasks (idea, plan, act, review).
- `prompts/`: Reusable prompts for Claude Code commands.
- `templates/`: Markdown templates for documentation.

### 📂 Context Engineering

- `context/`: Project related information used to brainstorm, plan and refine.
  - Below is an example of a possible context structure, adjust accordingly to your own project needs:
    - `actors/`: Who interacts with your system.
    - `components/`: Elements and system parts.
    - `concepts/`: Wiki style concepts.
    - `features/`: Descriptions of main features.
    - `platforms/`: Where your code runs (Supabase, GitHub, App Store, etc.).
    - `roles/`: Team member responsibilities.
    - `teams/`: Responsibilities and organization.
    - `models/`: Data structures and schemas.
- `conventions/`: Project conventions and best practices.
- `logs/`: Logs and records of project activities.
- `issues/`: Issue tracking and task management.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for managing the framework.

## 🥜 Syncing In A Nutshell

Running `plx sync claude` copies:

- all markdown files in `agents/` to:
  - `.claude/agents/`
    - allowing Claude Code to use them as [sub-agents](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents).
  - `.claude/commands/act/`
    - creates `/act:as-{filename}` commands, allowing you to use them as main agent through [commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands).
- `prompts/` to:
  - `.claude/commands/plx/`
    - creates easy to use (and remember) `/plx:{verb-filename}` [commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) (activities, instructions, plx do this, plx do that)
- `templates/` to:
  - `.claude/commands/use/`
    - creates `/use:{template-filename}` [commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands), allowing you to efficiently instruct an agent to use specific templates as output or work documents.

## 📚 WikiLinks

This framework uses [[Wiki Links]] to connect context documents, making it easy to navigate and understand relationships between different parts of your project.

### Update Mechanism
```bash
plx pull main
```
Downloads latest version from GitHub without git.

### Makefile System
`plx` is a wrapper around make:
1. `plx init` downloads the framework
2. All other commands pass through to `make`

### Default Commands

| Command                 | Description                                                             |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `plx pull main`         | Update to latest version from GitHub                                    |
| `plx sync claude`       | Sync agents, prompts, and templates to .claude/                         |
| `plx sync claude clean` | Clean sync - removes .claude/commands and .claude/agents before syncing |
| `plx watch claude`      | Auto-sync on file changes in agents/ and prompts/                       |

Add custom commands to Makefile:
```makefile
deploy:
	@echo "Deploying..."
	# deployment logic
```
Then run: `plx deploy`

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: NPM Package

```bash
npm install -g pew-pew-plx
plx init
plx sync claude
```

### Option 2: Git Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/its-brianwithai/pew-pew-plx.git
cd pew-pew-plx
make sync claude
```

## 🔧 Commands

```bash
plx init           # Download framework files
plx sync claude    # Sync to Claude Code config
plx sync claude clean  # Delete agents & commands + sync again
```

## 🎯 Pro Tips

### 📎 Link Files in Commands
When using writing commands, use @path/to/file.md without `backticks` to immediately trigger a read of the file(s) upon activation of the command.

## 🛠️ Scripts

The `scripts/claude-code/` directory contains shell scripts to manage the integration with Claude Code:

-   `sync-claude-code.sh`: The main script that runs the agent and command sync scripts.
-   `sync-claude-code-agents.sh`: Copies agent definitions to `.claude/agents/` and creates act-as commands in `.claude/commands/act/`.
-   `sync-claude-code-commands.sh`: Copies prompt files from `prompts/` to `.claude/commands/plx/`.
-   `watch-claude-code.sh`: A convenience script to monitor for file changes and trigger the sync automatically.
