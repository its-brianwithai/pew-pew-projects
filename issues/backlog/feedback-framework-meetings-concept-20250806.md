# 📝 Feedback: Meetings Concept Addition
> 💡 *Constructive feedback for adding a comprehensive meetings management system to the PLX framework. This feedback will be processed by the appropriate meta agent to enhance the framework.*

## 🎯 Component Details
> 💡 *Identify the specific component and its location within the PLX framework.*

**Component Type:** Framework Enhancement (Templates + Workflow)
**Component Name:** Meetings Concept System
**File Path:** `New feature - requires templates/ and workflows/ additions`
**Version/Last Modified:** New feature request - 2025-08-06

## 📊 Context & Usage
> 💡 *Describe how you were using this component when you identified areas for improvement.*

**Use Case:** Need for structured meeting documentation and real-time note-taking assistance during various meeting types (stand-ups, climate meetings, etc.)
**Interaction Type:** New feature request / Framework extension
**Related Components:** Templates system, Workflows system, Agent orchestration

## 🔍 Observations
> 💡 *Document specific behaviours, outputs, or characteristics that prompted this feedback.*

### What Worked Well
- Current template and workflow systems provide good foundation
- Agent orchestration exists for complex tasks
- File organization patterns are well-established

### Areas for Improvement
- **Issue:** No structured approach for meeting documentation
  - **Example:** Users need consistent format for different meeting types
  - **Impact:** Inconsistent meeting records and missed action items
- **Issue:** No real-time collaborative note-taking workflow
  - **Example:** During meetings, need agent to act as critical note-taker
  - **Impact:** Manual note-taking reduces meeting participation

## 💡 Suggestions
> 💡 *Provide specific, actionable suggestions for improving this component.*

1. **Meeting Template System**
   - **Current State:** No meeting-specific templates exist
   - **Proposed Change:** Create structured templates for different meeting types (stand-up, climate, general)
   - **Rationale:** Consistent format improves meeting quality and follow-up
   - **Implementation Notes:** Use hierarchical folder structure: `Meetings/YYYY/MM/DD/`

2. **Real-Time Meeting Workflow**
   - **Current State:** No workflow for live meeting assistance
   - **Proposed Change:** Create workflow that enables agent to act as critical note-taker
   - **Rationale:** Frees participants to focus on discussion while ensuring accurate records
   - **Implementation Notes:** Must research project context and ask clarifying questions

3. **Meeting Organization Structure**
   - **Current State:** No established meeting file organization
   - **Proposed Change:** Implement year/month/day folder structure
   - **Rationale:** Chronological organization enables easy retrieval and pattern analysis
   - **Implementation Notes:** Integrate with existing project folder conventions

### Reference Implementation
- Component: [[agent-template]]
- Relevant Pattern: Structured documentation with clear sections and guidance
- Component: [[refinement-workflow]]  
- Relevant Pattern: Multi-phase systematic approach with agent orchestration

## 🚀 Priority & Impact Assessment
> 💡 *Help prioritize this feedback by assessing its importance and impact.*

**Priority Level:** High
**Scope of Impact:** Framework-wide - affects templates, workflows, and agent systems
**User Impact:** Significantly improves meeting productivity and documentation quality
**Implementation Effort:** Moderate update - requires multiple component creation

## 🔗 Related Feedback
> 💡 *Link to any related feedback documents or issues.*

- This is the initial feedback for this concept
- May relate to future workflow optimization feedback

## 📋 Meta Agent Assignment
> 💡 *Indicate which meta agent should process this feedback.*

**Recommended Meta Agent:** [[meta-template-expert]] and [[meta-workflow-specialist]]
**Reasoning:** This requires both template creation (for meeting formats) and workflow design (for real-time assistance). The template expert should handle the meeting documentation templates, while the workflow specialist should design the live note-taking orchestration.

## 📝 Additional Notes
> 💡 *Any other context, considerations, or information that might be helpful.*

The critical note-taker functionality is particularly interesting - the agent should:
- Listen to meeting discussions
- Research relevant project information to provide accurate context
- Ask clarifying questions when needed  
- Update meeting documents in real-time
- Maintain critical/analytical perspective rather than passive transcription

This represents a sophisticated use case that combines multiple PLX framework capabilities: templates, workflows, agent intelligence, and project context awareness.
