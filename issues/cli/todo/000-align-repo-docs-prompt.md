We need to create a prompt that ensures all links, files, references, documentation, agents, prompts, and all types of files are up to date. The links should be correct, and the information within them must be accurate. Weâ€™ll do this based on a new type of context collection that will collection locations of similar importance. For example `context/collections/all-project-docs.md` will contain all the locations of files that are important to the project, such as `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and so on. This will ensure that we can always refer to the most up-to-date information in our project.

For agents we could have something like `context/collections/all-ai-docs.md` which will hold a collection of agents, prompts, etc that need to be updated when something structual about the project changes.
