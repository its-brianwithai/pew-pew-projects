## 🎯 Implementation Overview
> 💡 *High-level description of what was implemented and why*

This PR implements a comprehensive 6-phase Plan Workflow system that transforms vague user requests into detailed, actionable development plans. The workflow emphasizes progressive refinement, with each phase building upon the previous while maintaining flexibility for partial execution or phase skipping.

The implementation addresses the need for systematic project planning in AI-assisted development by providing:
- Specialized agents for each phase of planning
- Structured templates ensuring consistent documentation
- Orchestration patterns for complex multi-phase workflows
- Quality gates preventing incomplete specifications
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery strategies

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details
> 💡 *Detailed breakdown of all technical changes made*

### Plan Workflow Orchestrator System

#### What Changed
Created a hierarchical agent system with a master orchestrator managing 6 specialized phase agents, each responsible for a specific aspect of the planning workflow.

#### Code Examples
```
# Orchestrator Decision Tree
1. Assess Request
   ├─ New Feature → Full Sequential Mode
   ├─ Has Discovery → Partial Sequential
   ├─ Specific Phase → Single Phase Mode
   └─ Existing Docs → Update Mode

2. Execute Phases
   ├─ Phase 1: Discovery Agent
   ├─ Phase 2: Requirements Agent
   ├─ Phase 3: Refinement Agent (parallel capable)
   ├─ Phase 4: Story Agent
   ├─ Phase 5: Roadmap Agent
   └─ Phase 6: Implementation Agent (parallel capable)

3. Quality Gates
   └─ Validate outputs before progression
```

#### File References
- [[issue-workflow-orchestrator]] - Master orchestrator implementation
- [[discovery-agent]] through [[implementation-agent]] - Phase specialists
- [[issue-workflow]] - Complete workflow documentation

#### Reasoning
The orchestrator pattern was chosen to:
- Enable flexible execution strategies based on context
- Maintain separation of concerns between phases
- Support quality control at phase boundaries
- Allow for future workflow extensions
- Provide clear traceability from request to implementation

**Feedback:**

### Template Reorganization

#### What Changed
Migrated workflow-specific templates from `templates/plan/` to `templates/workflows/` and created 6 new phase-specific templates aligned with the Plan Workflow.

#### Code Examples
```
# Before: Scattered templates in plan/
templates/plan/
├── dev-plan-template.md
├── requirements-template.md
└── milestone-template.md

# After: Organized by workflow phase
templates/workflows/
├── discovery-template.md        # Phase 1
├── requirements-template.md     # Phase 2
├── refinement-template.md       # Phase 3
├── roadmap-template.md         # Phase 4
├── milestone-template.md       # Milestones
└── implementation-plan-template.md # Phase 5
```

#### File References
- [[discovery-template]] through [[implementation-plan-template]] - Phase templates
- [[pull-request-template]] - Comprehensive PR documentation

#### Reasoning
Reorganization provides:
- Clear mapping between phases and outputs
- Consistent structure across all phases
- Better discoverability of templates
- Logical grouping by workflow purpose

**Feedback:**

### Prompt System Enhancement

#### What Changed
Created 22 new/modified prompts following a create/update pair pattern for each phase, plus orchestrator prompts for full workflow execution.

#### Code Examples
```
# Individual Phase Prompt Pattern
1. Act as [[specialized-agent]]
2. Use ONE focused question at a time
3. Provide A/B suggestions
4. Iterate until complete
5. Follow [[phase-template]] exactly

# Orchestrator Prompt Pattern
1. Act as [[feature-workflow-orchestrator]]
2. Determine execution mode
3. Delegate to phase agents
4. Manage quality gates
5. Handle errors and recovery
```

#### File References
- [[create-issue]] / [[update-issue]] - Orchestrator prompts
- [[create-discovery]] through [[create-implementation-plan]] - Phase creation
- [[create-pr]] / [[update-pr]] - Enhanced PR management

#### Reasoning
The prompt system enables:
- Consistent interaction patterns
- Question-driven iterative refinement
- Clear agent delegation
- Flexible workflow execution
- Comprehensive documentation

**Feedback:**

### Refinement Block Library

```bash
# Template Sync Fix
# Before: Only root directory
for template_file in "$TEMPLATES_DIR"/*-template.md; do

# After: Recursive subdirectory search
for template_file in $(find "$TEMPLATES_DIR" -name "*-template.md" -type f); do

# Makefile Enhancement
pull: ## Pull updates from a branch or external repository
    @if [ -z "$(BRANCH)" ]; then \
        echo "Usage: make pull BRANCH=<branch-name|repo-url>"; \
    else \
        ./scripts/pull-updates.sh "$(BRANCH)"; \
    fi
```

#### File References
- [[sync-claude-code-templates.sh]] - Fixed template sync script
- Makefile - Enhanced with pull and watch commands

#### Reasoning

## 💼 Business Logic Changes
> 💡 *Document any changes to business rules or domain logic*

### Planning Methodology
- **Previous Behaviour:** Ad-hoc planning with inconsistent documentation
- **New Behaviour:** Systematic 6-phase workflow with progressive refinement
- **Impact:** All feature planning now follows a consistent, quality-controlled process
- **Example:** User request "build a chat app" produces:
  - Discovery: Actors (users, admins), Components (UI, API, database)
  - Requirements: Activity flows for sending/receiving messages
  - Refinement: Message properties, real-time behaviours
  - Stories: "As a user, I want to send messages..."
  - Roadmap: MVP milestone with 3 sprints
  - Implementation: Step-by-step technical plan

### Agent Orchestration
- **Previous Behaviour:** Single agents handling entire workflows
- **New Behaviour:** Orchestrator delegates to phase-specific specialists
- **Impact:** Better separation of concerns and expertise
- **Example:** Refinement agent focuses solely on technical specifications

### Documentation Standards
- **Previous Behaviour:** Varied documentation formats
- **New Behaviour:** Standardized templates with reusable blocks
- **Impact:** Consistent, comprehensive documentation
- **Example:** All user stories follow same format with effort estimates

**Feedback:**

## 🎨 UI Changes
> 💡 *Document any user interface modifications*

### Claude Code Commands
- **Visual Changes:** 22 new `/plx:` commands in command palette
- **Behavioural Changes:** Commands now invoke specific phase agents
- **Accessibility Impact:** More discoverable workflow phases
- **Example Commands:**
  - `/plx:create-feature` - Start full workflow
  - `/plx:create-discovery` - Start Phase 1 only
  - `/plx:update-story` - Refine existing stories

### Prompt Interaction
- **Visual Changes:** Question-driven interface with A/B options
- **Behavioural Changes:** Iterative refinement vs single response
- **Accessibility Impact:** Clearer guidance for users
- **Example:** "Which component needs refinement? A) User Authentication B) Message System"
