## 🎯 Implementation Overview
> 💡 *High-level description of what was implemented and why*

This implementation creates a complete, systematic workflow for transforming vague user requests into detailed implementation plans through a 6-phase process. The workflow emphasizes progressive refinement, with each phase building upon the previous while supporting standalone execution. The system is designed to be flexible, allowing users to start at any phase or execute the complete workflow end-to-end.

Key achievements:
- Created a hierarchical agent system with a main orchestrator and phase-specific specialists
- Implemented comprehensive templates for each phase's output
- Developed a prompt system for both creating new and updating existing documents
- Established clear quality gates and decision points between phases
- Maintained consistency with existing Pew Pew Plx patterns and conventions

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details
> 💡 *Detailed breakdown of all technical changes made*

### Issue Workflow Orchestrator

#### What Changed
Created the main orchestrator agent that coordinates the entire 6-phase workflow, managing phase transitions, quality gates, and delegating to specialist sub-agents.

#### Code Examples
```
# Phase Execution Flow
1. Analyze Current Context
   - Check for existing artifacts
   - Determine optimal entry point
   - Validate prerequisites

2. Execute Phase Sequence
   - Phase 1: Discovery → discovery-agent
   - Phase 2: Requirements → requirements-agent  
   - Phase 3: Refinement → refinement-agent
   - Phase 4: Roadmap → roadmap-agent
   - Phase 5: Implementation → implementation-agent
   - Phase 6: Story Creation → story-agent

3. Quality Gates
   - Validate phase outputs
   - Check completeness criteria
   - Determine if progression is warranted
```

description: "Create a new {phase} document"
---
Create a comprehensive {phase} document using [[{phase}-agent]] 
following [[{phase}-template]].

# Update Prompt Pattern  
---
name: update-{phase}
description: "Update an existing {phase} document"
---
Update the existing {phase} document using [[{phase}-agent]]
to refine and enhance based on new information.
```

## 💼 Business Logic Changes
> 💡 *Document any changes to business rules or domain logic*

### Workflow Execution Logic
- **Previous Behaviour:** Ad-hoc planning with no structured phases
- **New Behaviour:** Systematic 6-phase workflow with clear progression
- **Impact:** All feature planning now follows a consistent, quality-controlled process
- **Example:** User request "build a chat app" now produces discovery → requirements → refinement → roadmap → implementation plan → stories

### Agent Delegation Pattern
- **Previous Behaviour:** Single agents handling complex multi-step processes
- **New Behaviour:** Orchestrator delegates to phase-specific specialists
- **Impact:** Better separation of concerns and expertise
- **Example:** Refinement agent focuses solely on properties/behaviours/architecture
