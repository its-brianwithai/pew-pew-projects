# Feature Workflow Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the work completed on the Feature Workflow and outlines the remaining tasks needed to fully implement this systematic approach to transforming user requests into actionable development plans.

**GitHub Issue:** #3 (https://github.com/its-brianwithai/pew-pew-plx/issues/3)
**Pull Request:** #4 (https://github.com/its-brianwithai/pew-pew-plx/pull/4)

## Work Completed

### 1. Feature Workflow Structure
Created `/issues/workflows/000-WFL-plan-workflow/000-WFL-feature-workflow-initial-draft.md` which defines a 6-phase workflow:

1. **Phase 1: Discovery & Context Gathering** → `discovery-template.md`
2. **Phase 2: Requirements Elaboration** → `requirements-template.md`
3. **Phase 3: Refinement & Architecture** → `refinement-template.md`
4. **Phase 4: Milestone Planning** → `roadmap-template.md`
5. **Phase 5: Story Creation** → `story-template.md`
6. **Phase 6: Implementation Planning** → `implementation-plan-template.md`

### 2. Created Templates
All templates are in `/templates/workflows/`:

- **discovery-template.md** - Captures initial requests, actors/components, requirements, dependencies
- **requirements-template.md** - Expands requirements into activity flows and deliverables
- **refinement-template.md** - Defines properties, behaviors, and system architecture
- **roadmap-template.md** - Organizes deliverables into milestones with effort estimates
- **milestone-template.md** - Documents individual milestones in detail
- **story-template.md** - (existing at `/templates/plan/story-template.md`) - Creates detailed user stories from milestone deliverables
- **implementation-plan-template.md** - Provides detailed CRUD operations and action plans

### 3. Created Blocks
New blocks in `/blocks/refinements/`:

- **refinement-block.md** - Template for defining component properties and behaviors
- **architecture-diagram-block.md** - Template for system architecture visualization
- **milestone-block.md** - Template for milestone definitions

### 4. Key Design Decisions

- Each phase outputs a specific template type
- Templates are self-contained with full content (not just block references)
- Workflow supports both linear progression and jumping to any phase
- Heavy emphasis on refinement (Phase 3) following the refinement workflow
- Story template already exists at `/templates/plan/story-template.md` - use this instead of creating new

## Tasks Remaining

### 1. Create Sub-Agents
Create specialized agents for each phase in `/agents/plan/`:

- [x] **discovery-agent.md** - Specializes in Phase 1 discovery and context gathering
- [x] **requirements-agent.md** - Specializes in Phase 2 activity flows and deliverables
- [x] **refinement-agent.md** - Specializes in Phase 3 properties, behaviors, architecture
- [x] **roadmap-agent.md** - Specializes in Phase 4 milestone and story planning
- [x] **story-agent.md** - Specializes in creating detailed user stories from milestone deliverables
- [x] **implementation-agent.md** - Specializes in Phase 5 CRUD and action planning

Each agent should:
- Have deep expertise in their phase
- Reference their output template
- Include instructions for working with previous phase outputs
- Support standalone execution (not requiring previous phases)

### 2. Create Prompts for Each Template
Create prompts in `/prompts/` following the pattern of existing prompts:

#### Create Prompts (for starting fresh):
- [x] **create-discovery.md** - Start Phase 1 from scratch
- [x] **create-requirements.md** - Start Phase 2 from scratch
- [x] **create-refinement.md** - Start Phase 3 from scratch
- [x] **create-roadmap.md** - Start Phase 4 from scratch
- [x] **create-milestone.md** - Create individual milestone
- [x] **create-story.md** - Create user story from milestone
- [x] **create-implementation-plan.md** - Start Phase 5 from scratch

#### Update Prompts (for refining existing):
- [x] **update-discovery.md** - Refine existing discovery document
- [x] **update-requirements.md** - Refine existing requirements
- [x] **update-refinement.md** - Refine existing refinement
- [x] **update-roadmap.md** - Refine existing roadmap
- [x] **update-milestone.md** - Refine existing milestone
- [x] **update-story.md** - Refine existing story
- [x] **update-implementation-plan.md** - Refine existing implementation plan

### 3. Create Orchestrator Agent
Create `/agents/act/plan-workflow-orchestrator.md`:

- Coordinates the entire 5-phase workflow
- Delegates to phase-specific sub-agents
- Manages phase transitions and quality gates
- Supports both full workflow and partial execution
- Tracks progress and ensures deliverables

### 4. Create Workflow Prompts
Create prompts for the complete workflow:

- [ ] **create-plan.md** - Start the complete plan workflow from Phase 1
- [ ] **update-plan.md** - Update/refine an existing plan at any phase

These should:
- Invoke the plan-workflow-orchestrator agent
- Support starting at any phase
- Allow skipping phases if artifacts already exist

### 5. Create the Actual Workflow
Create `/workflows/plan-workflow.md`:

Structure:
```
# Plan Workflow

## Orchestrator
- [[plan-workflow-orchestrator]]

## Steps

### Step 1: Discovery
- Prompt: [[create-discovery]] or [[update-discovery]]
- Agent: [[discovery-agent]]
- Output: [[discovery-template]]

### Step 2: Requirements
- Prompt: [[create-requirements]] or [[update-requirements]]
- Agent: [[requirements-agent]]
- Output: [[requirements-template]]

[etc for all 5 phases]
```

### 6. Update README
Add to the main README.md:

- New section: "Plan Workflow"
- Explain the 5-phase approach
- How to start the workflow: `plx create-plan`
- How to jump to specific phases
- How to update existing plans
- Link to workflow documentation

## Important Implementation Notes

1. **Standalone Execution**: Each phase must work independently. Users should be able to start at Phase 3 if they already have Phases 1-2 done elsewhere.

2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Each phase builds on the previous but doesn't require it. Agents should gracefully handle missing context.

3. **Template Consistency**: All templates follow the same YAML frontmatter structure with name, description, and instructions fields.

4. **WikiLink Usage**: All internal references use `[[filename]]` format without paths or extensions.

5. **Existing Assets**: Use the existing story template at `/templates/plan/story-template.md` rather than creating a new one.

## Quick Start for Next Agent

1. Start by creating the sub-agents for each phase
2. Then create the create/update prompts for each template
3. Create the orchestrator agent that ties everything together
4. Create the workflow definition
5. Update the README with usage instructions

The goal is a complete, flexible workflow that transforms vague user requests into detailed implementation plans through a systematic 5-phase process.
