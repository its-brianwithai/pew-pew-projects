# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Pew Pew Plx is an AI-powered project management framework that syncs specialized agents, templates, and prompts with Claude Code. It provides a structured approach to software development through context engineering and orchestrated workflows.

## Common Development Commands

### Primary Commands
```bash
# Initialize the framework (only needed once)
plx init

# Sync agents, prompts, and templates to Claude Code
plx sync claude

# Clean and re-sync Claude Code configuration
plx sync claude clean

# Pull latest updates from a branch
plx pull main      # Pull from main branch
plx pull beta      # Pull from beta branch

# Pull from external repositories
plx pull https://github.com/user/repo.git main
plx pull git@github.com:user/repo.git develop

# Watch for changes and auto-sync
plx watch claude
```

### Development Workflow
1. Make changes to agents, prompts, or templates
2. Run `plx sync claude` to update Claude Code configuration
3. Use `/plx:{prompt-name}` commands in Claude Code to access prompts
4. Use `/act:as-{agent-name}` commands to invoke specific agents
5. Use `/use:{template-name}` commands to apply templates

## Architecture & Structure

### Framework Components

1. **Agents** (`agents/`) - Specialized AI agents organized by workflow phase:
   - `discovery/` - Research and exploration agents
   - `plan/` - Planning and documentation agents (story, epic, milestone, etc.)
   - `act/` - Implementation agents (commands, hooks, meta-agent)
   - `review/` - Review and quality agents (code-review, work-log)
   - `context/` - Context management agents (convention, role, team)
   - `template/` - Template-specific agents for document sections

2. **Prompts** (`prompts/`) - Reusable command prompts that become `/plx:` commands:
   - `start.md`, `plan.md`, `refine.md` - Workflow initiators
   - `improve.md`, `review-code.md` - Quality improvement
   - `create-issue.md`, `commit.md` - Development tasks

3. **Templates** (`templates/`) - Markdown documentation templates that become `/use:` commands:
   - Story, Epic, Milestone templates for project management
   - Architecture, PRD, Dev Plan templates for technical documentation
   - Workflow templates for process documentation

4. **Context** (`context/`) - Project-specific information:
   - `actors/`, `components/`, `features/` - System elements
   - `platforms/` - Integration points and deployment targets
   - `roles/`, `teams/` - Organization structure

5. **Workflows** (`workflows/`) - Orchestrated multi-agent processes:
   - `refinement-workflow.md` - Project concept to PRD/Architecture
   - `requirements-workflow.md` - Requirements gathering process
   - `feature-conversion-workflow.md` - Feature migration process

### Sync Mechanism

The framework syncs to Claude Code's configuration:
- Agents � `.claude/agents/` (as sub-agents) and `.claude/commands/act/` (as commands)
- Prompts � `.claude/commands/plx/` (as `/plx:` commands)
- Templates � `.claude/commands/use/` (as `/use:` commands)

WikiLinks (`[[filename]]`) are automatically converted to full paths (`@.claude/plx/filename.md`) during sync.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has a specific role and follows a structured format with Purpose, Core Capabilities, Workflow, and Report sections.

2. **Template-Driven Documentation**: All documentation follows predefined templates for consistency.

3. **Orchestrated Workflows**: Complex tasks use orchestrator agents that delegate to specialist sub-agents.

4. **Context Engineering**: Heavy emphasis on maintaining project context through structured documentation.

5. **Command Integration**: Seamless integration with Claude Code through custom slash commands.

## Working with Agents

Agents follow a standard structure:
- Frontmatter with name, description, and color
- Purpose section defining the agent's role
- Core Capabilities outlining what the agent can do
- Workflow describing the step-by-step process
- Report/Response format specification

When creating new agents:
1. Place in appropriate directory under `agents/`
2. Follow existing agent structure and conventions
3. Include references to related templates and agents
4. Run `plx sync claude` to make available in Claude Code

## Extension Points

The framework is designed to be extended:
- Add custom agents for project-specific needs
- Create new templates for documentation types
- Define workflows for complex processes
- Extend the Makefile for custom commands

Custom make commands can be added to the Makefile and run with `plx <command>`.
