```

## 📁 Corrected Physical Structure
Previously reorganized all existing issues to follow the convention:
```
issues/
└── tech/
    └── framework/
        ├── cli/
        │   ├── CLI-000-backlog/
        │   ├── CLI-001-create-plx-cli/
        │   ├── CLI-002-sync-repo-command/
        │   └── CLI-003-sync-refactor/
        ├── configuration/
        │   ├── CFG-000-backlog/
        │   ├── CFG-001-config-yaml-implementation/
        │   └── CFG-002-modes-concept/
        ├── templates/

```

## 🎯 Key Principles Enforced

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All files now reference [[issue-creation-conventions]]
2. **Everything Together**: ALL documents related to an issue stay in the same folder
3. **Proper Hierarchy**: department → team → subject → specific issue
4. **Consistent Naming**: {SUBJECT-CODE} used in both folder and file names
5. **No Orphan Documents**: Feedback, reports, plans all go with their issues

## ❌ Eliminated Old Patterns
- `issues/active/`, `issues/done/`, `issues/backlog/` - REMOVED
- `feedback/` directory for standalone feedback - ELIMINATED
- Hardcoded paths in individual files - REPLACED with WikiLinks
- Flat structure without department/team - RESTRUCTURED

## ✅ Verification
- All document creation files now reference the central convention
- WikiLink pattern ensures updates propagate automatically
- Structure matches the required naming convention exactly
- No documents will be created outside the proper structure

## 🔄 Future Maintenance
With WikiLinks in place, any future updates to the convention only need to be made in one place: 
`/Users/codaveto/Repos/pew-pew-plx/.pew/instructions/conventions/issue-creation-conventions.md`

All document creation will automatically follow the updated convention.
