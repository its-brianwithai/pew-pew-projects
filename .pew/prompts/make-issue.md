## 🔄 Workflow
> 💡 *Atomic steps that systematically achieve the end goal.*

### Step 1: Content Analysis
**Deliverable:** Parsed understanding of source
**Acceptance Criteria:** All elements identified

Analyze source content for:
- **Stated Requirements**: What's explicitly mentioned?
- **Implied Requirements**: What's assumed or implied?
- **Actors**: Who/what is involved?
- **Actions**: What happens or should happen?
- **Goals**: What outcomes are desired?
- **Constraints**: What limitations exist?
- **Context**: What background is relevant?

Document findings:
```markdown
## Extraction Map
- Requirement: "[Source text]" → [Formal requirement]
- Actor: "[Context]" → [Identified actor]
- Flow: "[Description]" → [Event sequence]
- Goal: "[Desired outcome]" → [Acceptance criterion]
```

### Step 2: Requirement Formalization
**Deliverable:** Formal requirements list
**Acceptance Criteria:** All requirements captured

Transform extracted elements:
1. **From Informal to Formal**
   - "It would be nice if users could..." → "**User** should be able to..."
   - "We need better performance" → "**System** should respond in < 200ms"
   - "Make it work offline" → "**Application** should cache data for offline use"

2. **Fill Missing Details**
   - Add actors where implied
   - Specify conditions where vague
   - Include error cases

3. **Structure Requirements**
   - Group by actor
   - Order by priority
   - Number for reference

### Step 3: Actor Flow Construction
**Deliverable:** Complete event sequences
**Acceptance Criteria:** Logical flow established

Build flows from content:
1. **Identify Interactions**
   - Who initiates what?
   - What triggers events?
   - How do actors respond?

2. **Sequence Events**
   - Chronological order
   - Cause and effect chains
   - Parallel processes

3. **Add Data Flows**
   - What information moves?
   - What format/structure?
   - What validation needed?

Example transformation:
```
Source: "User uploads a file, we process it, then show results"
→
1. **User** → selects → file
   - Data: File object (max 10MB)
2. **User** → uploads → file
   - Data: Multipart form data
3. **System** → validates → file
   - Data: File type, size, content
4. **System** → processes → file
   - Data: Extracted content
5. **System** → displays → results
   - Data: Processed output
```

### Step 4: Deliverable Inference
**Deliverable:** CRUD operations mapped
**Acceptance Criteria:** All events have deliverables

Infer deliverables from requirements:
1. **Analyze Each Event**
   - What needs to exist?
   - What changes?
   - What gets consumed?

2. **Map to CRUD**
   - Create: What's new?
   - Read: What's accessed?
   - Update: What's modified?
   - Delete: What's removed?

3. **Identify Components**
   - Database operations
   - File system changes
   - API calls
   - UI updates

### Step 5: Acceptance Criteria Generation
**Deliverable:** Comprehensive test conditions
**Acceptance Criteria:** All scenarios covered

Generate criteria from goals:
1. **Success Conditions**
   - From: "Should work properly"
   - To: "✓ File uploads successfully"
        "✓ Processing completes < 5 seconds"
        "✓ Results display accurately"

2. **Failure Prevention**
   - From: "Don't lose data"
   - To: "✓ No data loss on network failure"
        "✓ No corruption during processing"

3. **Invariants**
   - From: "Keep it secure"
   - To: "✓ Only authenticated users can upload"
        "✓ Files are virus-scanned"

4. **Prohibitions**
   - From: "Prevent abuse"
   - To: "✓ No files > 10MB accepted"
        "✓ No executable files allowed"

### Step 6: Gap Identification
**Deliverable:** List of clarifications needed
**Acceptance Criteria:** All gaps documented

Identify what's missing:
- Unspecified actors
- Incomplete flows
- Missing error handling
- Undefined data formats
- Absent performance requirements
- Unclear boundaries

Mark with placeholders:
```markdown
[TODO: Confirm max file size]
[TODO: Specify supported file types]
[TODO: Define error message format]
```

### Step 7: Issue Assembly
**Deliverable:** Complete issue document
**Acceptance Criteria:** Template followed exactly

Assemble into [[issue-template]]:
1. Add appropriate emoji and title
2. Write brief description
3. Populate all sections
4. Add mermaid diagrams
5. Format acceptance criteria as checklists
6. Include clarification needs

## 📏 Instructions
> 💡 *Event-driven best practices, conventions, constraints and rules.*

### WHEN analyzing content
**Best Practices:**
- Look for action verbs
- Identify pain points
- Note desired outcomes

**Content Types:**
- Conversations: Extract requests and agreements
- Notes: Identify action items
- Ideas: Find concrete capabilities
- Feedback: Extract specific improvements
- Specs: Formalize requirements

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS preserve original intent
- NEVER ignore context clues
- MUST capture unstated assumptions

### WHEN formalizing requirements
**Best Practices:**
- Use consistent actor names
- Start with action verbs
- Make measurable where possible

**Formalization Patterns:**
- Wishes → Requirements
- Problems → Solutions
- Ideas → Specifications
- Complaints → Improvements

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS use **Actor** should format
- MUST be specific enough to implement
- NEVER lose original meaning

### WHEN constructing flows
**Best Practices:**
- Start with trigger events
- Follow logical sequence
- Include all actors

**Flow Building:**
- Identify initiator
- Map interactions
- Show data movement
- Include responses

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS show complete paths
- MUST specify data
- NEVER skip implicit steps

### WHEN inferring deliverables
**Best Practices:**
- Think about implementation
- Consider all side effects
- Map to concrete changes

**Inference Patterns:**
- "Store X" → Create database record
- "Show Y" → Read and display data
- "Change Z" → Update existing record
- "Remove W" → Delete from system

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS be specific about operations
- MUST cover all events
- NEVER leave deliverables vague

### WHEN generating criteria
**Best Practices:**
- Extract success from goals
- Infer failure from risks
- Derive invariants from constraints

**Generation Patterns:**
- Goals → Success conditions
- Risks → Failure prevention
- Rules → Invariants
- Limits → Prohibitions

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS make binary (pass/fail)
- MUST be verifiable
- NEVER use subjective measures

### WHEN identifying gaps
**Best Practices:**
- Note all assumptions made
- Flag unclear elements
- Mark missing information

**Gap Categories:**
- Missing: Not mentioned but needed
- Unclear: Mentioned but vague
- Conflicting: Contradictory information
- Assumed: Inferred but unconfirmed

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS document gaps clearly
- MUST suggest clarifications
- NEVER hide uncertainties
