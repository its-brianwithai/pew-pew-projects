# Create Issue

Create a new issue following the issue workflow to break down requirements into scoped, developer-ready work items.

## Instructions

1. If the user has provided a clear request or requirement, proceed to create an issue based on that request
2. If no clear request is provided, ask the user: "What would you like to create an issue about? Please describe the feature, bug, or improvement you need."
3. Once you have a clear request, follow the issue workflow to systematically decompose it into properly scoped work items
