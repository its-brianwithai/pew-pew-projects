3. Read current template and check blocks/ for patterns
4. Update while preserving conventions and structure
</process>

    A. Structure and sections (add/remove/reorganize)
    B. Content and instructions (placeholders, guidance)
</example>

<constraints>
- ALWAYS read current template before updating
- ALWAYS preserve YAML front matter structure
- ALWAYS maintain self-contained nature
- NEVER break established conventions
- ONLY update requested aspects
</constraints>

<request>
