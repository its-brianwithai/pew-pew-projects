## üîÑ Workflow
> üí° *Step-by-step process to achieve the end goal*

### Step 1: Information Gathering
**Deliverable:** Complete understanding of topic/release
**Process:**
1. Check for existing conversation context:
   - If this command runs after an existing conversation, analyze the previous messages
   - Look for recently created/updated artifacts, features, or significant work
   - Identify the main topic or achievement from the conversation
   - Confirm with user: "I see we just [created/updated/worked on] [specific item]. Should I create content drafts about [this specific achievement]?"
   - Example: "I see we just created the 'update-everywhere' prompt for comprehensive project-wide updates. Should I create content drafts about this new prompt?"
2. Systematically gather comprehensive information:
   - Topic/feature name and context
   - Target audience segments (tech bros/girls, indie hackers, professionals)
   - Key benefits and problems solved
   - Technical specifications (if applicable)
   - Unique insights or perspectives
   - Visual assets available or needed
   - Timeline and urgency
