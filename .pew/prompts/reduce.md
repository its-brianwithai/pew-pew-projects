- Transform into measurable objective
- Present for confirmation
- Allow adjustment via "change goal to..."

### Step 2: Question Generation
**Deliverable:** YES/NO reduction questions
**Acceptance Criteria:** Questions target scope optimization
- Focus on essential vs nice-to-have
- Identify deferrable features
- Suggest phased approaches
- Target resource optimization

### Step 3: Progress Tracking
**Deliverable:** Goal progress update
**Acceptance Criteria:** Clear advancement shown
- Track answered questions
- Show reductions identified
- Update MVP definition
- Adjust focus as needed

## üìè Instructions

### WHEN establishing goals
**Best Practices:**
- Transform vague desires into specific objectives
- Make goals measurable and achievable
- Focus on concrete MVP outcomes

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS establish goal before questions
- NEVER proceed with vague objectives
- MUST confirm goal with user

### WHEN generating reduction questions
**Pattern:** "Can we defer [X] to later?"
**Focus Areas:**
- Essential vs nice-to-have
- Core functionality identification
- Resource optimization
- Phased delivery opportunities

**Question Examples:**
- "Is authentication required for MVP?"
- "Can we launch without analytics?"
- "Should we postpone multi-language support?"
- "Can we defer advanced features to v2?"
- "Is real-time sync essential for launch?"

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS use YES/NO format
- ALWAYS be specific about deferrals
- NEVER ask open-ended questions
- MUST use A/B checkbox format

### WHEN processing responses
**Best Practices:**
- Acknowledge reductions identified
- Show concrete progress toward goal
- Generate follow-up questions based on answers
- Track cumulative scope optimization

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS show goal progress
- MUST track all reduction decisions
- NEVER lose sight of objective
