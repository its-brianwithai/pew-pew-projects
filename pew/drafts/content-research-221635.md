Pew Pew Prompts – Cross-Platform Content & Posting Strategy Table

Platform	Top-Performing Post Types	Suggested Content Topics/Themes (Pew Pew Prompts)	Where to Post (Exact Places/URLs)	Posting Frequency & Ideal Timing	Strategy Notes (Tone, CTAs, Repurposing, etc.)
Twitter/X	• Short tweets (text-only quips or quick tips, often with an image/GIF for attention)• Threads (multi-tweet “tweetstorms” to explain a concept or share a story in depth)• Polls & Questions (to engage followers and invite replies)• Visual memes or infographics (lightweight, shareable content riding trending topics)	• Prompt engineering tips – bite-sized tricks or examples of prompts that yield great results• “Building in public” updates – tweet about progress, milestones, or lessons learned in developing the AI app/course• Founder insights – personal takes on startup life, productivity hacks using AI, etc.• AI news commentary – react to trending AI news or breakthroughs with your perspective (establishes thought leadership)• Indie hacker tools – shout-outs to tools (incl. your own) that help founders, positioning your brand in that ecosystem	• On your brand’s Twitter profile (e.g., @pewpewprompts). Use a recognizable handle and brand logo.• Utilize hashtags for reach (e.g., #PromptEngineering, #AI, #BuildInPublic) and tag relevant influencers or communities when appropriate.• Engage in Twitter Chats or trending threads (e.g., reply to @IndieHackers tweets) to increase visibility through conversation.	• Frequency: High – aim for daily activity (posting 2–3 times per day is ideal ￼ for steady presence). Twitter’s fast pace means more posts = more chances to be seen (as long as quality holds).• Timing: Post during peak engagement hours. Studies show weekday late mornings through early afternoons (approx. 9am–2pm) Tuesday to Thursday have strongest engagement ￼ ￼. Tweets during these mid-week, mid-day windows are more likely to get impressions and replies.• You can also experiment with off-peak times (evenings or weekends) to reach global followers, but prioritize the busy mid-week slots for important content.	• Tone: Keep it casual, witty, and concise. Twitter is informal – use a personable voice, emojis or GIFs where appropriate, and jump on relevant memes/trends to humanize your brand.• Engagement CTAs: Encourage interaction – e.g., end tweets with a question (“What do you think?”) to prompt replies, or explicitly ask for retweets if sharing something noteworthy. Polls are great for quick feedback (e.g., “What AI topic should we cover next? 🗳️”).• Content mix: Follow the “rule of thirds” – 1/3 of tweets directly promote your product or content, 1/3 share personal/founder stories, 1/3 curate or comment on industry news/tips ￼. This keeps your feed interesting and not overly self-promotional.• Community interaction: Don’t just broadcast – reply to mentions and comments promptly, and proactively engage with other accounts (comment on industry influencers’ posts, partake in trending discussions). This builds relationships and can attract their followers to you.• Repurposing: Turn juicy bits of your blog posts or newsletter into tweet threads (e.g., “🧵 5 tips to write better AI prompts…” with one tip per tweet). Conversely, if a tweet thread sparks lots of interest, consider expanding it into a full blog post. Re-use successful content in different formats.

| LinkedIn        | • Long-form text posts (plain text or text + single image, up to ~1300 chars – great for storytelling or how-to tips in a few paragraphs)• Document carousels (multi-page PDF slides that users can swipe ￼ – useful for “5 Tips” listicles or mini case studies with visuals)• Image posts (photos or infographics with a descriptive caption – e.g., a chart showing AI productivity gains)• Native video (short videos <5 min uploaded directly, like a demo or talking-head explainer)• LinkedIn Polls (quick 1-question polls that tend to generate easy engagement – use sparingly to gauge audience interests) | • Prompt engineering use-cases for professionals – e.g., “How sales teams can use AI prompts to save time” (tailor AI benefits to different job roles or industries)• Building-in-public/founder story – share your startup journey milestones, lessons learned in entrepreneurship, personal growth through the project (LinkedIn audience loves authentic founder narratives)• AI productivity hacks – LinkedIn is full of professionals, so offer value like “3 AI tips to free up 5 hours a week” or insights on work-life balance using AI• Indie hacker tools/resources – posts like “Top 5 tools I used to build my AI app” or an experience with an indie hacker community event (ties your brand into the broader startup ecosystem)• Thought leadership on AI – broader reflections on where AI is going, how to ethically use AI, or commentary on major AI news, establishing your expertise beyond your product | • Post on your personal LinkedIn profile (often better reach than brand pages, especially if you as founder have a decent network). Make sure your profile mentions Pew Pew Prompts and has a follow link to the company page.• Also share via the LinkedIn Company Page for Pew Pew Prompts (even if smaller following, it’s good for credibility; you can reshare the founder’s post there). Ensure the company page is up-to-date with branding and links.• Consider relevant LinkedIn Groups: e.g., “Artificial Intelligence Enthusiasts” or local startup groups. You can share content or start discussions there, but note group engagement on LinkedIn is typically lower than feed engagement.• Utilize LinkedIn features: tag people or companies if referenced (e.g., mention OpenAI or a person who coined a concept), and use 2-3 hashtags (LinkedIn hashtags like #AI #Startup #Productivity) to help discovery. | • Frequency: Aim for 3–5 posts per week (roughly every weekday). LinkedIn’s algorithm favors consistency but not multiple posts per day – one strong post a day or even 3-4 per week is sufficient to stay top of mind ￼. Avoid posting twice in one day; let each post breathe for 24h.• Timing: Best engagement tends to be during the workweek, especially mid-week mornings. Posts on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday around the beginning of the work day or lunch (say 10am–12pm local business time) often perform well ￼. This catches professionals when they check LinkedIn in the morning or midday.• Generally, avoid late evening or weekends for critical posts – LinkedIn usage drops then. If you do post on Mondays, mid-morning is better than early (people catching up on emails first). Fridays can be okay late morning, but content might get less engagement going into weekend. • Monitor your insights – if you notice your audience engaging more at a certain hour (e.g., 9am vs 11am), adjust future scheduling to that window. | • Tone: Professional yet personal. Write in first person and share personal experiences or “lessons” – this creates authenticity. However, keep a professional polish (proper grammar, no memespeak) and focus on how your story can benefit the reader (insight or inspiration). Avoid overt selling; frame things as sharing knowledge.• Structure posts for “see more”: Only the first ~3 lines show before the “…see more” cut. Start with a hook – a bold statement or intriguing question (e.g., “I almost gave up on my AI startup last year. Here’s what changed my mind…”). This improves the click-through to read the rest.• Encourage comments: Engagement drives visibility on LinkedIn. End posts with a question or an invitation: “Have you tried something similar? Let me know👇” or “What’s your biggest productivity challenge?”. People love to share their take, and more comments = more reach.• Visuals and format: Posts with visuals (images or PDFs) often stand out. Use an eye-catching graphic or a succinct carousel. Data shows image and video posts have higher reach now, whereas pure text is declining unless very sharp ￼. So repurpose key stats or tips into a simple graphic when possible. For carousels, keep each slide minimal (1 idea or a few words) for quick swiping.• Repurposing: Take a successful tweet or Twitter thread and adapt it into a LinkedIn post (expand acronyms, add context for a broader audience). Conversely, if a LinkedIn post sparked great discussion, screenshot or summarize key points to tweet. Also, you can elaborate on LinkedIn posts to become full blog articles, then in a future LinkedIn post link to that article (with a compelling lead-in in the post and the link after a few lines or in comments to avoid algorithm penalties). |

| Instagram       | • Carousel posts (multiple images or graphics that users swipe through – great for mini-tutorials, listicles, or step-by-step guides in a visually engaging way)• Reels (short-form vertical videos, 15–60 sec, leveraging trending audio – high reach tool for educational skits, quick tips, or showcasing your product in action in a fun way)• Static image posts (a single photo or infographic – e.g., a quote about AI, a meme, or a before/after screenshot from your app – paired with a descriptive/captivating caption)• Stories (ephemeral 24-hr posts for daily engagement – behind-the-scenes clips, quick polls/quizzes, sharing user testimonials or reposting community content)• IG Live / IGTV (occasional live streams for Q&A or longer video content, which can later be saved as an IGTV/video – good for special events or announcements) | • Visual prompt tips: e.g., a carousel “5 Phrases to Improve Your AI Prompts” with each slide showing a phrase and example. Or a Reel demonstrating one prompt hack with text overlay.• Building in public moments: Share photos or short videos of your workspace, coding late night, the team meeting, hitting “enter” on a prompt – humanize the process. Caption with a relatable story (“Startup life: 100th coffee while tweaking our AI model at 2am”).• Founder/founder life posts: Motivational or personal posts – maybe a photo of you speaking at an event about AI, or a selfie with a thoughtful caption on overcoming imposter syndrome as an indie hacker.• AI productivity inspiration: e.g., an infographic with stats (“30% of tasks can be automated with AI ￼”) and caption on using time saved for creativity. Also share quick wins – “Used AI to draft an email 10x faster – feeling like a superhuman 💪”.• Community/content promotion: Announce new blog posts or YouTube videos in Stories (“New tutorial up – swipe up to learn how to …”), share user-generated content (if a user tweets about loving your course, screenshot and share in Stories), celebrate milestones (1000 users!) with a nice graphic to involve your audience in the journey. | • On your brand’s Instagram account (@pewpewprompts) – primary feed for main content (carousels, Reels, images), and Stories for daily snippets.• Instagram Reels tab: Focus on Reels for discovery – IG’s algorithm pushes Reels to new audiences. Use relevant music and hashtags on Reels to increase reach.• Hashtags: Use a mix of popular and niche hashtags in posts (e.g., #promptengineering #IndieHacker #AI #solopreneur #startuplife). Aim for ~5–15 hashtags – ensure they are relevant; avoid spammy tags. Hashtags like #AIart or #ChatGPT might attract general AI fans, whereas #bootstrapping or #IndieHacker hits your founder niche.• Geotag if relevant (e.g., if attending an event in Amsterdam, geotagging can get local eyeballs).• Cross-posting: Consider automatically sharing IG posts to Facebook via Meta, since your audience might overlap. Also, high-performing Reels can be downloaded (without watermark using tools) and re-uploaded as TikToks (and vice versa).• Profile link: Use the link in bio effectively – consider a Linktree or a custom landing page that directs traffic to your course, latest blog, etc. Mention in captions “Link in bio for the full guide” when you want to drive traffic. | • Frequency: Post consistently, around 3–5 feed posts per week ￼ as a baseline. This keeps your profile active without overwhelming followers. You can adjust as you gauge content effort vs. return. Additionally, try to post Stories daily (even a few short clips each day) – Stories keep existing followers engaged and coming back, and Instagram’s head recommends ~2 Stories per day for healthy engagement ￼.• Timing: Optimal posting times tend to be weekday mornings or early afternoons. Data suggests Monday–Thursday between ~10am and 3pm yields strong engagement windows ￼ (with a typical peak around lunch hours). For example, posting a carousel at 11:00am can catch the lunch break scrollers. ￼ Many users also check IG in the evenings (~7–9pm), so if your insights show high activity then, that’s a good secondary window. Avoid posting important content at odd hours (e.g., 3am) when most of your audience is offline.• Use IG Insights: over time, identify when your followers are most active and refine your posting schedule. Also consider time zones – if you have a global audience weighted to e.g. Europe and US, mid-day US (which is evening Europe) can be a sweet spot. | • Aesthetic & branding: Instagram is visual – maintain a consistent style (color palette, fonts, tone of imagery) so that your posts are recognizable. This could mean using your brand colors for text overlays or having a signature layout for carousel tips. Consistency builds brand identity and makes your feed look professional.• Captions that connect: Don’t just describe the image – tell a micro-story or provide additional value. The first line of caption should hook (it’s like a headline before the “… more” cut). Use a casual, friendly tone. Emojis are welcome 👍 (they catch the eye and convey emotion). For example, start with “🔥 Big lesson learned: …” or “🤖💡 Quick AI Tip: …”. Then deliver context. End with a prompt for action: a question (“Agree or disagree? 🤔”), an encouragement to save (“Save this post to try later!”) or share, or a nudge to check link in bio.• Leverage Instagram features: Engage followers via Stories – e.g., use the Poll sticker (“Would you use an AI to draft emails? Yes/No”), Quiz sticker (“Test your AI knowledge: which of these can GPT-4 do…”), Question sticker (“Ask me anything about AI prompts!” for an AMA vibe). These interactions keep you on followers’ radar and provide feedback/content ideas. Share the results or answer questions in subsequent Stories to show responsiveness.• Use trending elements: On Reels, hopping on a trending audio or meme format can boost views – but ensure it aligns with your message (e.g., a trending dance – maybe not; a trending audio clip – perhaps you overlay text about AI tips on it). Even a silly meme once in a while (AI-themed humor) can make your brand relatable and shareable.• Cross-promotion CTA: Occasionally remind IG followers about your other channels: e.g., “DM me 💌 your email to get our free weekly AI newsletter” or “New full tutorial on YouTube – snippet in bio, check it out!”. Since link sharing is limited (one link in bio), use stories for link stickers or instruct followers clearly how to access your content elsewhere (Instagram audience often needs a bit of direction to leave the app). |
