## 📋 Request
> 💡 *Verb-first activity request with optional deliverables and acceptance criteria*

Guide the user through systematic issue creation by:
1. Asking their preferred creation mode (section-by-section or multi-section)
2. Gathering initial feature information
3. Facilitating section completion based on chosen mode
4. Applying refinement through question-mode
5. Producing a complete issue following the template

### Deliverables
- Complete issue document following [[issue-template]]
- All sections populated with relevant content
- Mermaid diagrams for flows and connections
- Comprehensive acceptance criteria checklists

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User's feature is clearly understood
- [ ] All template sections are complete
- [ ] Requirements are specific and actionable
- [ ] Actor flows show clear event sequences
- [ ] Deliverables map to each event
- [ ] Acceptance criteria cover success, failure, and invariants

## 🔄 Workflow
> 💡 *Atomic steps that systematically achieve the end goal.*

### Step 1: Mode Selection
**Deliverable:** Clear understanding of user's preferred creation approach
**Acceptance Criteria:** Mode selected and workflow path determined

Ask the user:
```markdown
# Issue Creation Mode Selection

How would you like to create your issue?

**Option A: Section-by-Section Creation** 📝
- I'll guide you through each section individually
- We'll refine each section before moving to the next
- Best for: First-time users or complex issues
- Estimated time: 15-20 minutes

**Option B: Multi-Section Improvement** 🚀
- Provide initial content for multiple sections
- I'll help improve and refine them together
- Best for: Experienced users or simpler issues
- Estimated time: 10-15 minutes

Please type **A** or **B** to select your preference.
```

### Step 2: Initial Information Gathering
**Deliverable:** Basic understanding of the feature/issue
**Acceptance Criteria:** Feature name, description, and key actors identified

Gather:
- Issue title and appropriate emoji
- Brief feature description
- Primary actors involved (User, System, Admin, etc.)
- Core problem being solved

### Step 3A: Section-by-Section Creation (if Mode A selected)
**Deliverable:** Each section completed and refined individually
**Acceptance Criteria:** Section meets template requirements before proceeding

For each section in order:
1. **Initial Requirement Section**
   - Guide user to list capabilities
   - Help break down complex requirements
   - Apply question-mode refinement
   
2. **Actor Flow Section**
   - Map event sequences
   - Identify data flows
   - Create sequence diagram
   
3. **Deliverables Section**
   - Map CRUD operations per event
   - Identify components
   - Create component diagram
   
4. **Acceptance Criteria Section**
   - Define success conditions
   - Identify failure preventions
   - Establish invariants
   - List prohibited conditions

### Step 3B: Multi-Section Improvement (if Mode B selected)
**Deliverable:** All sections improved simultaneously
**Acceptance Criteria:** Complete draft refined to production quality

Process:
1. Request user's initial draft (can be rough/incomplete)
2. Analyze all sections for:
   - Completeness gaps
   - Clarity issues
   - Missing connections
   - Inconsistencies
3. Apply batch improvements:
   - Enhance requirements specificity
   - Clarify actor flows
   - Complete deliverable mappings
   - Strengthen acceptance criteria
4. Present improved version for review

### Step 4: Refinement Application
**Deliverable:** Refined issue with all ambiguities resolved
**Acceptance Criteria:** Issue passes quality checks

Apply question-mode to refine:
- **🔄 Simplify**: Can we combine similar requirements?
- **❓ Clarify**: Are all actors and events unambiguous?
- **🔧 Improve**: What details would help developers?
- **➕ Expand**: What edge cases need coverage?
- **➖ Reduce**: What's out of scope for this issue?

### Step 5: Final Assembly
**Deliverable:** Complete issue ready for assignment
**Acceptance Criteria:** Issue follows template exactly

- Ensure all sections are populated
- Verify internal consistency
- Add mermaid diagrams
- Format acceptance criteria as checklists
- Apply final polish

## 📏 Instructions
> 💡 *Event-driven best practices, conventions, constraints and rules.*

### WHEN gathering requirements
**Best Practices:**
- Start with user capabilities, then system behaviors
- Use specific verbs in requirements
- Break complex requirements into atomic pieces

**Conventions:**
- Use **Actor** should format
- Group related requirements together
- Number requirements for reference

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS use simple English sentences
- NEVER use technical jargon in requirements
- MUST be testable conditions

### WHEN mapping actor flows
**Best Practices:**
- Follow chronological event order
- Include all data transfers
- Show both happy and error paths

**Conventions:**
- Use **Actor** → verb → object pattern
- Include "Data:" subsections for each event
- Create mermaid sequence diagrams

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS identify the initiating actor
- MUST show data flow between actors
- NEVER skip intermediate steps

### WHEN identifying deliverables
**Best Practices:**
- Map to CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Be specific about what changes
- Link deliverables to events

**Conventions:**
- Group by event
- Use bullet points for each operation
- Include component connection diagrams

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS specify tangible outputs
- MUST cover all events
- NEVER use vague terms like "handle" or "process"

### WHEN defining acceptance criteria
**Best Practices:**
- Cover positive, negative, and invariant conditions
- Make criteria binary (pass/fail)
- Think about edge cases

**Structure Pattern:**
- What should always go right? (success paths)
- What should never go wrong? (failure prevention)
- What should always be? (invariants)
- What should never be? (prohibited states)

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS use checklist format
- MUST be verifiable conditions
- NEVER use subjective criteria

### WHEN in section-by-section mode
**Best Practices:**
- Complete one section fully before moving on
- Apply refinement after each section
- Build on previous sections

**Conventions:**
- Show progress indicator
- Summarize completed sections
- Preview next section

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS validate section before proceeding
- MUST maintain consistency across sections
- NEVER skip refinement step

### WHEN in multi-section mode
**Best Practices:**
- Review all content holistically
- Identify cross-section dependencies
- Batch similar improvements

**Conventions:**
- Present changes with explanations
- Highlight major improvements
- Maintain user's core intent

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS preserve user's original intent
- MUST improve clarity and completeness
- NEVER remove content without explanation

### WHEN using question-mode for refinement
![[question-mode]]

## 📊 Output Format
