## 🔄 Workflow
> 💡 *Atomic steps that systematically achieve the end goal.*

### Step 1: Initial Concept Discovery
**Deliverable:** Clear understanding of the core problem and initial ideas
**Acceptance Criteria:** Problem statement defined and initial capabilities identified

Gather:
- What problem are we solving?
- Who will use this feature?
- What's the desired outcome?
- What currently exists (if anything)?
- What inspired this requirement?

Apply initial discovery questions:
- "What would success look like?"
- "What's the most important capability?"
- "What can't change about current behavior?"

### Step 2: Capability Brainstorming
**Deliverable:** Comprehensive list of potential capabilities
**Acceptance Criteria:** All dimensions of functionality explored

Explore capabilities across dimensions:
1. **Core Capabilities** - What must it do?
2. **User Interactions** - How will users engage?
3. **System Behaviors** - How should the system respond?
4. **Data Operations** - What data is involved?
5. **Integration Points** - What connects to this?
6. **Constraints** - What limits exist?

For each dimension, ask:
- What's the happy path?
- What could go wrong?
- What variations exist?
- What's the minimal version?
- What would be ideal?

### Step 3: Edge Case Discovery
**Deliverable:** Complete list of edge cases and boundary conditions
**Acceptance Criteria:** All exceptional scenarios identified

Systematically explore:
- **Boundary Conditions**: Minimum/maximum values, empty states, limits
- **Error Scenarios**: Invalid inputs, system failures, network issues
- **Concurrent Operations**: Multiple users, race conditions, conflicts
- **State Transitions**: Invalid sequences, interruptions, rollbacks
- **Permission Scenarios**: Access control, authorization failures
- **Data Scenarios**: Missing data, corrupted data, unexpected formats

Use edge case prompts:
- "What if [X] happens while [Y]?"
- "What's the worst input we could receive?"
- "What if this fails halfway through?"
- "What if multiple users do this simultaneously?"

### Step 4: Requirements Refinement
**Deliverable:** Refined requirements with resolved ambiguities
**Acceptance Criteria:** All requirements are specific and testable

Apply systematic questioning using ALL 5 types:

**🔄 Simplify Questions:**
- "Can we combine these similar requirements?"
- "Is there a simpler way to achieve this goal?"
- "Can we reuse existing functionality?"

**❓ Clarify Questions:**
- "When you say [term], do you mean [specific interpretation]?"
- "Is [requirement] a hard requirement or nice-to-have?"
- "Does [capability] need to work offline?"

**🔧 Improve Questions:**
- "Should we add [specific enhancement] to make this better?"
- "Would [additional capability] improve user experience?"
- "Should we include [quality attribute]?"

**➕ Expand Questions:**
- "Do we need to handle [additional scenario]?"
- "Should we support [additional user type]?"
- "Have we considered [related capability]?"

**➖ Reduce Questions:**
- "Is [feature] essential for the first version?"
- "Can we defer [capability] to a later phase?"
- "Could we launch without [enhancement]?"

### Step 5: Scope Definition
**Deliverable:** Clear boundaries of what's in and out of scope
**Acceptance Criteria:** Explicit scope statements documented

Define clear boundaries:
1. **In Scope** - What we WILL build
   - List specific capabilities included
   - Define success criteria
   - Identify must-have features

2. **Out of Scope** - What we WON'T build (yet)
   - List explicitly excluded features
   - Document future considerations
   - Note intentional limitations

3. **Assumptions** - What we're taking as given
   - Environmental assumptions
   - User behavior assumptions
   - Technical assumptions

### Step 6: Priority Assignment
**Deliverable:** Prioritized requirement list
**Acceptance Criteria:** All requirements have clear priority

Apply MoSCoW prioritization:
- **Must Have**: Core requirements without which the feature fails
- **Should Have**: Important requirements that add significant value
- **Could Have**: Nice-to-have requirements if time permits
- **Won't Have**: Explicitly out of scope for this iteration

### Step 7: Final Documentation
**Deliverable:** Complete requirements ready for issue creation
**Acceptance Criteria:** Requirements documented in actionable format

Structure requirements as:
```markdown

# Usage Notes

## Philosophy
This prompt focuses exclusively on the requirements discovery phase, recognizing that getting requirements right is the foundation of successful development. It applies systematic questioning and exploration techniques to uncover hidden requirements, edge cases, and scope boundaries.

## Key Differentiators from create-issue
- **Focus**: Only on requirements, not implementation details
- **Depth**: Goes deeper into edge cases and scenarios
- **Breadth**: Explores all dimensions of requirements
- **Output**: Requirements document, not issue structure

## Integration with Issue Creation
The output from this prompt is designed to feed directly into [[create-issue]] prompt, providing the comprehensive requirements needed for the "Initial Requirement" section.

## Question-Mode Integration
This prompt heavily leverages question-mode for systematic refinement, using all 5 question types to ensure comprehensive requirement coverage.

## Best For
- New feature exploration
- Complex requirement discovery
- Unclear or vague initial requests
- Projects needing thorough analysis
- Pre-implementation planning sessions

## Not For
- Simple bug fixes
- Clear, well-defined tasks
- Technical implementation details
- Architecture decisions
- Code-level specifications
