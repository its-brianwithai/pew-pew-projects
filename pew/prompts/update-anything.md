## 📋 Request
> 💡 *Verb-first activity request with optional deliverables and acceptance criteria*

Update the user's existing artifact by:
1. Analyzing the current artifact's structure and content
2. Identifying improvement opportunities against best practices
3. Determining which components to add, modify, or remove
4. Planning the update strategy (incremental vs comprehensive)
5. Applying improvements while preserving core intent
6. Extracting shareable components where beneficial
7. Suggesting further evolution paths

### Deliverables
- Updated artifact following current best practices
- List of improvements made with rationale
- Extracted components (if applicable)
- Migration notes for breaking changes
- Suggested next improvements

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Original intent is preserved or clarified
- [ ] All improvements add measurable value
- [ ] Updated artifact follows current conventions
- [ ] Components are properly modularized
- [ ] Wikilinks are correctly implemented
- [ ] No functionality is lost without explanation
- [ ] Update path is clear and reversible

## 🔄 Workflow
> 💡 *Atomic steps that systematically achieve the end goal.*

### Step 1: Current State Analysis
**Deliverable:** Complete understanding of existing artifact
**Acceptance Criteria:** All components and patterns identified

- Read and parse the entire artifact
- Identify artifact type and intended purpose
- Map current component structure:
  - What components exist?
  - Which follow conventions?
  - What's the modularity level?
- Note wikilink usage and opportunities
- Document original author's intent

### Step 2: Gap Identification
**Deliverable:** Prioritized list of improvement opportunities
**Acceptance Criteria:** Gaps mapped to specific fixes

Apply create-anything philosophy to identify:
- **Missing Components**: What would contribute to the goal?
- **Unnecessary Components**: What doesn't serve the purpose?
- **Convention Violations**: What doesn't follow patterns?
- **Modularity Issues**: What could be extracted or combined?
- **Wikilink Opportunities**: What could reference existing artifacts?
- **Clarity Gaps**: What's ambiguous or unclear?

### Step 3: Update Strategy Selection
**Deliverable:** Clear plan for applying updates
**Acceptance Criteria:** Strategy chosen and justified

Choose approach based on gap analysis:

**Option A: Incremental Enhancement**
- Small, focused improvements
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Low risk, gradual evolution
- Best for: Production artifacts, minor gaps

**Option B: Comprehensive Refactoring**
- Major structural improvements
- May break compatibility
- Higher risk, bigger payoff
- Best for: Early artifacts, significant gaps

### Step 4: Component-by-Component Updates
**Deliverable:** Each component improved or replaced
**Acceptance Criteria:** Component meets current standards

For each component requiring update:
1. **Analyze Current State**
   - What works well?
   - What needs improvement?
   - Can it be extracted?

2. **Apply Improvements**
   - Follow [[prompt-template]] or appropriate template
   - Use proper wikilink patterns
   - Apply [[entity-implementation-rules]]
   - Consider extraction opportunities

3. **Validate Changes**
   - Does it better serve the goal?
   - Does it follow conventions?
   - Is it more reusable?

### Step 5: Sharding Opportunity Execution
**Deliverable:** Extracted components as separate files
**Acceptance Criteria:** Components are reusable and linked

Identify and extract:
- Personas that could be reused
- Workflows that apply elsewhere
- Instructions that are general
- Output formats that are standard
- Any component used multiple places

Create separate files and replace with wikilinks:
- Standard: `[[component-name]]` for references
- Embedded: `![[component-name]]` for inclusion

### Step 6: Integration Testing
**Deliverable:** Validated updated artifact
**Acceptance Criteria:** All improvements work together

- Verify all wikilinks resolve
- Check component interactions
- Ensure examples follow rules
- Validate against original goals
- Test conceptual usage scenarios

### Step 7: Evolution Documentation
**Deliverable:** Clear record of changes and next steps
**Acceptance Criteria:** Update path is traceable

Document:
- What changed and why
- Breaking changes (if any)
- Migration instructions
- Extracted components
- Suggested future improvements
- Natural evolution toward agent (if applicable)
