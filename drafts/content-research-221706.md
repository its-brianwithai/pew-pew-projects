| Threads (Meta)  | • Short text posts (Threads is primarily a text-based conversation platform, so quick thoughts, one-liners, or witty observations work well)• Conversational threads (series of replies to your own post – less formal than Twitter threads, but you can still chain a story or multiple points by replying to the first post)• Images/GIFs with text (an image can add humor or context to a text post, and GIFs can make your interactions more lively in a platform that’s text-first)• Short videos (Threads allows video; a brief clip of you sharing an insight or a demo might stand out amidst text, though keep it casual/mobile friendly) | • In-the-moment thoughts on AI/tech: Use Threads for spontaneous commentary – e.g., a quick reaction to a new ChatGPT feature or sharing excitement/frustration about a coding session (“Spent 2 hours tweaking a prompt and it finally worked 🎉 #SmallWins”). This shows the human side of building your AI project.• Community questions: Since Threads is conversation-centric, ask for opinions: “Indie hackers, how are you using AI this week?” or “What’s one task you wish AI could do for you? 🤖💭”. These spark replies and make your profile a hub for discussion (good for visibility).• Prompt challenges/games: e.g., “Two-word prompt challenge: describe your Monday in 2 AI prompt words. Go.” – playful content that aligns with your brand theme and encourages engagement.• Build/launch updates in a casual tone: Unlike the more polished LinkedIn or Twitter announcement, on Threads you might say “🤞 Launching on ProductHunt tomorrow – currently experiencing equal parts excitement and panic. Send coffee.” It’s relatable and fits the candid vibe of the platform.• Cross-posted tips from Twitter/LinkedIn, but simplified: If you have a list of tips that was a thread on Twitter, you might break it into a few separate Threads posts over time. Threads has no character limit initially, but users prefer short bursts – so maybe share one tip at a time as individual posts throughout the day/week. | • On Threads (via your Instagram-linked profile) – your username is the same as IG, and followers sync. Post directly in the Threads app.• There aren’t hashtag or trend mechanics (at least initially), so discoverability comes from engagement and network. Therefore, reply liberally to others in the AI/startup space on Threads – your replies can be seen by others and drive people to your profile. For example, reply to Meta’s or OpenAI’s announcements with a witty take (many users will scroll replies).• No specific groups or subforums – it’s one big feed. So also encourage your IG followers to join you on Threads (mention on IG Stories “We’re on Threads now for daily casual updates!”). Early adoption could mean more reach as the platform grows.• Leverage the integration: if you have active IG followers, many will auto-follow on Threads. You can also share a particularly good Threads post back to IG (e.g., screenshot a popular Threads conversation and post in IG Stories) to show the value of following you there.• Where to engage: Aside from posting your content, spend time in Threads replying to accounts with overlapping audience. For instance, if an AI influencer posts “AI’s not going to replace jobs, it’s going to augment them” on Threads, you could reply with your brief take. These interactions can attract followers more effectively on Threads’ conversational platform. | • Frequency: 2–3 posts per day is a good target ￼. Threads, like Twitter, is real-time and rewards frequent posting. Given it’s a newer platform, there’s less formal “timing” data, but being consistently present (morning, afternoon, evening short posts) keeps you in the mix. Don’t worry about over-posting as long as you’re adding value or personality – the feed is algorithmic, so only highly engaged posts spread widely, and others just fade out.• Timing: Since Threads usage patterns mirror Instagram’s to some extent, try morning and daytime posts. For example, post once in the morning (9-10am) perhaps a question or news reaction, and once in afternoon (2-3pm) maybe a tip or update. You might also do an evening casual check-in (“Good night from Amsterdam 👋, today I learned…”) if you find users online.• The lack of hashtags means timing is about when people are scrolling. Many use Threads during breaks or off-work hours for now (since it’s tied to IG, which is often off-work usage). So consider an after-dinner post (~8-9pm) if your audience skews to that behavior. It could differ by region – use initial weeks to observe when you get replies and adjust accordingly.• Also, be ready to jump on trending conversations in real-time: If there’s a hot topic (say, a big AI win or controversy) and people are Threads-ing about it, join in right then rather than waiting – the immediacy can gain you visibility. | • Tone: Threads is described as having a more casual, friendly vibe (akin to early Twitter). Write as if chatting with friends. It’s okay to use colloquial language, emojis, and even text formatting (if available) for emphasis. The goal is to be approachable and “human.” ￼ Show personality – if you’re excited, use exclamation points; if you’re joking, maybe a “😅” emoji to convey tone.• Personality & brand voice: Because Threads doesn’t yet have a huge brand presence, it’s an opportunity to make your brand voice distinct. Are you the witty AI guy? The encouraging coach? The curious experimenter? Lean into that. E.g., if something goes wrong, you might post “Welp, our prompt experiment crashed and burned today 🤷‍♂️. Back to the drawing board!” – self-deprecating and real.• Foster community: A key strategy is to act like a conversation starter. A post on Threads can be treated like opening a chat: “Anyone else feel like their AI output sounds like a fancy Magic 8-Ball sometimes? 😂”. Such prompts invite others to chime in with their experiences. Acknowledge and like replies you get – maybe even “👏” or “💯” react (as text) to good ones – this encourages more people to join in, seeing that you’re responsive. Threads rewards this kind of back-and-forth engagement.• Cross-pollination: Use your Threads content elsewhere – e.g., if a particular quip or insight you posted on Threads resonates (lots of replies or likes), screenshot it and share on Twitter (“I said this on Threads today and people loved it – thoughts?”) or expand it into a LinkedIn post. Conversely, you can take a popular tweet you had and post it verbatim on Threads; different audience might appreciate it anew.• Keep it upbeat: Current Threads culture (as of now) trends positive and inclusive (less snarky than Twitter can be). You can stand out by being optimistic or supportive. For instance, cheer on others (“Saw @someIndie got their first user – congrats! 🎉 Remembering how that felt. Keep going!”). Building others up on Threads can indirectly shine light on you as a community player, not just self-focused.• Monitoring: Since Threads lacks advanced search, use external tools or just scroll your feed for relevant convos. You might also announce on Threads when you have bigger content elsewhere (“I’m dropping a detailed blog tomorrow 🔥 – will share link here!”) to create anticipation among your followers on that platform. |

| TikTok          | • Short vertical videos (15s, 30s, up to 3min if needed – but snappy <60s clips often perform best for educational content)• Talking-head tips (you speaking to camera giving a quick prompt tip or insight, possibly with captions – builds personal connection)• Screen recording demos (show your phone/computer screen using an AI tool or your app, with voiceover explaining – e.g., “Watch me use our prompt tool to draft a blog paragraph in 20 seconds”)• Trends & memes (using trending sounds or formats but tailored to AI/productivity – e.g., the popular “Put a finger down” trend but do “Put a finger down if you’ve ever… [spent all night debugging AI code]” for relatable humor)• Behind-the-scenes montages (quick cuts of your day as a founder, coding, meeting, sipping coffee – set to music – gives a story vibe without heavy content) | • Micro how-tos: e.g., “3 Prompt Hacks in 30 Seconds” – a fast-paced list of tips with on-screen examples and text. Educational content does well if delivered quickly and clearly (viewers often watch repeatedly to absorb tips). ￼• Myth busting or FAQ: Pick a common misconception (“Can AI replace Google?”) and do a 60s video addressing it with facts or your take. Or answer a community question from elsewhere in video form (great way to repurpose FAQs from your users).• Founder life snippet: fun/relatable skits or voiceovers – e.g., lip-sync to a trending audio that matches a startup scenario (“Nobody: … Me at 2am: just one more deployment.”). Use humor that resonates with tech/indie audience – this can go viral and humanize your brand.• Showcasing results: Visual before-and-after using your prompt techniques – for example, show a messy paragraph vs. a polished paragraph after using your prompt. Could be a text overlay or green-screen effect with you in front of examples. This highlights the value of good prompts or your product in an eye-catching way.• Tool highlights and reviews: Quickfire review of a tool (maybe your own or adjacent tools) – “AI Tool of the Week” with a demo. If you feature others, they might share it, and it positions you as a go-to source for AI tool info. | • On your TikTok profile (@pewpewprompts or similar) – ensure your bio clearly states what you offer (e.g., “AI prompt tips 💡 Indie Hacker 💻, Teaching you to harness AI like a pro. 🚀”). Include your link (once you’re eligible) or a Linktree in bio for your app/course.• For You Page targeting: Use relevant hashtags on TikTok like #AI #PromptEngineering #SmallBusiness #IndieHacker so the algorithm knows who to show it to. Also include keywords in your video captions (TikTok’s algorithm can parse text and speech to categorize content).• Leverage trends: Keep an eye on the TikTok “Discover” page for trending sounds/challenges. When you see one that you can creatively relate to AI or startups, jump on it quickly (trends have short lifespans). E.g., if a song is trending with people sharing “things I wish I knew sooner,” make “Things I wish I knew sooner about AI prompts” to that audio.• Stitch and Duet: Great TikTok-native way to engage. Stitch: find a viral TikTok about AI or productivity, use the first few seconds and then add your commentary. Duet: side-by-side with, say, an AI art generation – you reacting or explaining. This way you piggyback on existing content interest while adding value or personality.• Cross-post: Save your TikToks (use the raw video before the TikTok watermark appears, or use tools to remove it) and repost on Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. This maximizes reach from one content piece. You might tweak captions or music per platform. But often a good short video can work across all three.• Community interaction: Reply to comments on your TikToks – and consider using TikTok’s feature to create a new video reply to a comment (if someone asks “How did you do that?”, make a follow-up video answering). This increases engagement and time spent by users on your content. | • Frequency: 3–5 videos per week at minimum ￼. On TikTok, more can be better – some creators post daily or even multiple times a day. TikTok itself mentioned small businesses can post up to 4 times/day with no hard limit ￼, but focus on what you can sustain. Quality and consistency are key. Start with a few per week and ramp up if you see traction and can handle content production. Regular posting helps hit different algorithm cycles and audience segments.• Timing: TikTok’s algorithm will show content to users over time, but posting when your likely audience is online gives an initial boost. Data indicates afternoons are strong: e.g., Wednesdays 2–5pm are particularly high engagement ￼. Also, Monday–Thursday generally from lunch through late afternoon (12pm–5pm) see above-average engagement ￼. Many users scroll TikTok in the evening as well (7–10pm) – those can work for lighter content. Try posting at different times and see when you get faster pickup in views.• Because TikTok can “hold” content and then suddenly spike if it finds an audience, don’t worry if immediate views are low; focus on consistently hitting good times. Perhaps start with a schedule like Mon/Wed/Fri at 3pm, plus Sat at 10am (weekend mornings can also be good as people lounge with TikTok). Adjust based on your analytics (TikTok Pro account will show you when your followers are most active).• If aiming for global reach, note time zones: you might occasionally post in off-hours to catch, say, Asian markets or night owls, but primarily cater to your core audience’s timezone. | • Hook fast: TikTok viewers decide in 1–2 seconds whether to watch or scroll. Begin videos with an intriguing hook – visually and verbally. For instance, start with a bold statement (“This prompt trick saved me 2 hours today…”) or a flashy visual (big text on screen like “PROMPT HACK: do this next time ➡️”). You can also use TikTok’s text-to-speech or big caption text in the first seconds to grab attention.• Keep it snappy: Even if you have up to 60s, try to deliver value continuously. Fast cuts, energetic delivery, and not dwelling too long on one shot can retain viewers. Use captions on-screen for accessibility and engagement – many watch on mute, plus it reinforces your message.• Trends vs evergreen: Balance trend participation with evergreen tips. Trends might get you bursts of views (and show your brand’s fun side), while evergreen educational content could keep gaining views over time and establish your credibility. Doing both widens your reach. For example, a comedic trending sound one day, and a serious how-to next day.• CTAs: On TikTok, typical CTAs are at the end in text or spoken – “Follow for more AI tips!”, “Link in bio for the full guide”, or even “Like and share if this was useful 🙌”. Don’t overload every video with a hard CTA, but sprinkle them in when appropriate. A subtle way is ending a tip series with “…there’s more, but I’m out of time – follow me so you don’t miss future tips!”.• Authenticity & fun: TikTok audience appreciates realness and entertainment. Don’t be afraid to show your personality, goofy moments, or learning process. For instance, posting a fail (“Watch me completely mess up an AI prompt 😂”) can make you more relatable and still educate by showing what not to do. Keeping a light-hearted, experimental tone can set you apart from overly polished corporate content.• Leverage TikTok features: Use effects and green screen – e.g., you can green-screen your website or code in the background while you explain it. This is engaging and informative. Also, jump on duets/stitches (as mentioned) to engage with community content. If someone asks a question in a video, stitch it with your answer. This not only provides content ideas but taps into existing interest on that topic.• Community building: As you gain followers, consider occasional “community” videos: e.g., respond to a user comment with a shoutout or do a challenge (“Try this prompt and comment your result”). Showing that you listen and interact will turn casual viewers into fans. |

| YouTube         | • Long-form videos (5–15 min typical, up to ~20 min for deep dives – tutorials, explainers, recorded webinars or interviews. Allows detailed content with screen shares, slides, etc.)• YouTube Shorts (vertical under-60s videos – often repurposed TikToks/Reels or quick tips tailored to YouTube. Great for discoverability and engaging short attention spans, can funnel viewers to longer content)• Live streams / Premieres (occasional live Q&A or coding session; or pre-recorded video scheduled as Premiere to engage viewers in chat as it debuts – good for launches or special events)• Community posts (text/image/poll posts on your channel’s Community tab – not video, but helps keep audience engaged between uploads, e.g., run a poll “What topic do you want next?” or share a behind-scenes photo)• Playlist series (thematic grouping of videos, e.g., a series called “Prompt Engineering 101” – while not a “post type” per se, organizing in playlists encourages binge-watching) | • Tutorials & how-tos: e.g., “How to Craft the Perfect Prompt for ChatGPT” – a step-by-step screencast of you demonstrating prompt techniques, with explanations. Educational content is a staple on YouTube and builds authority (plus these can rank in search).• Use case demos: Videos like “Using AI to Write Marketing Copy – Case Study” where you take a real scenario and solve it with prompts (possibly featuring your product). Real-world examples attract those looking to solve similar problems.• Product walkthroughs: When your app gets updates, do a video “Pew Pew Prompts 2.0 – New Features Overview” showing off the interface and how to use new features. Even do comparative videos (“Using Pew Pew Prompts vs. Traditional Prompting: side by side results”). This not only serves your users but also is discoverable content for potential users.• Founders insights / vlogs: e.g., a video of you talking about “5 Lessons I Learned Building an AI Startup” – just you, possibly with some b-roll of your workday. This personal content can engage people who follow your journey (and can be easier to produce with minimal editing).• Interviews & collaborations: If possible, collaborate with other AI or productivity YouTubers – perhaps invite an expert to talk about prompts or appear on their channel. Or interview an early user of your product about their experience. Collabs can expose both audiences to each other. | • Your YouTube channel (named Pew Pew Prompts, with branded channel art). Ensure the About section and links are filled (link to your site, newsletter, etc.) and organize content into playlists for easy navigation (e.g., Tutorials, Build in Public, Shorts, Live Sessions).• Video SEO: Post on YouTube with optimized titles/descriptions: include keywords like “AI prompts”, “ChatGPT tutorial”, etc., so search and YouTube’s algorithm can surface your videos. Use relevant tags as well (though tags are less critical than title/description).• Community Tab: Once you have access (usually after 500 subs), use the Community tab to post updates, behind-the-scenes, or polls. E.g., share a screenshot of a cool prompt result or ask “What AI topic should I cover next?” This keeps subscribers warm between video uploads.• YouTube Shorts shelf: Upload Shorts to tap into the vertical short video feed (similar to TikTok/Reels). Shorts can attract new viewers quickly, who might then subscribe or watch your long videos. Use them for quick tips or to tease longer content (“Quick Tip: [tip]… for a full tutorial, check our latest video.”).• External sharing: Embed your videos on your website (in blog posts) and share YouTube links on social media and newsletters to drive initial traffic (which can help YouTube algorithm if it sees engagement coming in early). Also, consider posting your video on relevant subreddits or forums if the content fits (without being spammy) – e.g., a tutorial video could be shared in r/educationalDIY or r/ArtificialIntelligence if it’s informative. ￼• YouTube Search & Suggestions: Many users will find you via YouTube search or recommended. So consider making some content that answers common queries (how to do X in AI) – these can rank over time and act as perpetual traffic sources. | • Frequency: Aim for a regular upload schedule – e.g., 1 video per week to start ￼. Consistency is more important than high frequency. Viewers will come to expect new videos at a certain pace. If you can handle two per week (say, one tutorial and one short vlog), even better, but don’t compromise quality. It’s fine to start weekly and later increase if you have capacity (or do weekly plus occasional bonus Shorts).• Timing: YouTube viewers tend to peak in early afternoons and evening. Data suggests an upload around 1pm (in your target time zone) is optimal on weekdays ￼, as it gives YouTube time to index and start showing your video for the after-work viewer surge. Many creators schedule uploads for Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday early afternoon, which aligns with general findings that mid-week is strong for engagement ￼. However, check your YouTube Studio analytics (“When your viewers are online” graph) after you have some audience – tailor to those patterns (e.g., if a lot are online at 7pm, maybe release at 6pm to catch them).• If you Premiere a video, choose a time you can be online to chat – that interactive aspect can boost initial engagement. For live streams, evenings (7–9pm) or weekend slots might get more attendance since people have free time, but consider your audience’s schedule.• One strategy is to maintain a consistent day (“New videos every Tuesday”) – this helps loyal subscribers anticipate content. Meanwhile, Shorts can be posted more flexibly on other days since they target new eyeballs mostly.• Note: Avoid long gaps between videos – if you need a break, use the Community tab to let followers know you’ll be back. Consistency helps with the YouTube algorithm and viewer retention (they don’t forget about you). | • Content quality: Good audio and clear visuals matter. Invest in a decent microphone and ensure screen recordings or text in videos are high resolution. You don’t need super fancy production – even a webcam + slides can work if info is gold – but clear sound is a must (viewers will bounce if volume is low or unclear). Consider adding subtitles/captions (YouTube auto-captions, but you can edit them for accuracy) for accessibility and those watching without sound.• Engagement tactics: Within videos, ask viewers to like and subscribe and comment – but do it genuinely. For example, “If this tip was useful, give this video a like so more people discover it ￼. And let me know in the comments what AI task you want help with – I might make a video about it!” Encourage comments by asking specific questions at the end of your video. More engagement signals can improve your video’s reach via YouTube’s algorithm.• Visual branding: Use a consistent style for thumbnails (e.g., a certain color border, or your face on one side and big bold text on the other) – this makes your content identifiable in suggested videos. Thumbnails should be clear and enticing (think of them as mini-adverts for the video – use a few words that hit the main point, like “Save 5 Hours with AI!” or a provocative question). High CTR on thumbnails helps a lot.• SEO & descriptions: In descriptions, provide value and links. E.g., summarize key points, link to your website or the featured tools, and include timestamps (chapters) for longer videos. This not only helps SEO but user experience (they might jump to the part they care about, which is fine – better than leaving). Use keywords in description naturally (“In this video, we explore prompt engineering for GPT-4, showing examples of prompts for marketing, coding, and more.”). The more YouTube knows about your content, the better it can recommend it.• Repurposing and promotion: Each YouTube video can spawn multiple content pieces: post a teaser clip on Twitter/LinkedIn, embed the video in a related blog article, transcribe the video and edit into a written article for your site (good for SEO and for those who prefer reading). Conversely, if you have a popular blog post, make a video covering the same topic – you already know there’s interest (and you can refer readers to the video for a walkthrough). Also mention your newsletter in videos (“I share tips like this weekly in my newsletter – link in description to join free”) to cross-pollinate your audience.• Community building: Treat your subscribers as a community. Greet them (“Hey PewPew crew!” or similar) in videos, and maybe give shoutouts (“One of you asked about X in the comments, so here’s the answer…”). Respond to comments on your videos regularly – the first hours after posting, try to reply to every comment; it encourages more people to comment when they see you’re active. Over time, loyal fans might even create a small community (you could start a Discord or Slack for your users – that’s another channel!). |

| Reddit          | • Text posts (self-posts): Detailed write-ups or stories shared directly in a subreddit (no external link needed in the post body). These often perform best when sharing knowledge or a narrative, as Redditors can read it in one go ￼.• Image posts: If you have a compelling graphic or chart (e.g., an infographic of prompt dos and don’ts), you can post an image with an explanatory title/text. Memes or humorous relevant images can also do well, but ensure they fit the subreddit vibe.• Link posts: Posting a direct link to your blog or video. Use only in subreddits that allow them and if the content is highly relevant (link posts can be perceived as spam unless genuinely useful). Often better to do a text post summary and include the link at the end or in a comment.• AMA (Ask Me Anything): Announce yourself in a relevant subreddit (with mod permission if needed) for an AMA – e.g., “I’m an indie founder who built an AI prompts app, AMA.” This can drive engagement and awareness, though it requires having a compelling story and some existing interest.• Comments: Not a post type on its own, but answering questions in other people’s threads can be an excellent way to build credibility and subtly mention your expertise or product. A highly upvoted comment with useful info can sometimes drive more traffic than a fresh post. | • Prompt engineering subreddits: e.g., r/PromptEngineering – share specialized tips or start discussions (“What’s the most clever prompt you’ve used?”) in a community that’s exactly your target. Also subs like r/PromptDesign or r/ChatGPTPromptGenius may exist for sharing prompt ideas.• General AI/tech subreddits: r/ChatGPT (huge community, mostly Q&A and sharing prompts – helpful answers or interesting use cases can get traction), r/ArtificialIntelligence (for news/discussions, more academic/industry lean), r/MachineLearning (very research-focused, only post if highly technical content). These can be good for broad exposure if you contribute meaningful insights.• Founder/indie subreddits: r/IndieHackers, r/startups, r/Entrepreneur, r/SaaS, r/SideProject – here you’d share your startup journey, marketing tactics, etc., rather than just AI tips. For example, a post on r/Entrepreneur: “I built an AI tool to automate tedious tasks – here are 5 things I learned from my first 6 months and $0 to $500 MRR” would fit well (it’s a story with value, not just promotion). Always angle posts as sharing experience or asking for advice, not advertising.• Productivity/self-improvement subreddits: r/Productivity, r/GetMotivated (if you have motivational angle), r/LifeProTips (if phrased as a tip), etc. These have wide audiences that might appreciate AI tool tips to save time. Just be careful to adhere to each sub’s content rules.• Posting vs. commenting: On Reddit, sometimes it’s better to comment on an existing highly visible thread than to post your own. E.g., if someone asks in r/smallbusiness “What tools do you use to save time?”, you can comment a helpful list and mention your tool casually – that can yield traffic if upvoted. Monitor relevant subreddits for questions you can answer authoritatively. | • Frequency of posts: Limit self-originated posts to perhaps 2–4 per month across relevant subreddits to avoid being perceived as spam or self-promoter. You can distribute them – one substantial post in r/IndieHackers this week, another in r/PromptEngineering next week, etc. Focus on quality over quantity: a single well-crafted post that gets upvoted is far more valuable than frequent low-engagement posts.• Commenting frequency: Aim to comment almost weekly if not daily on relevant threads (when you have something to add). Regular helpful commenting builds karma and rapport. For instance, spending 10 minutes a day scanning AI or startup subreddits’ new questions and tossing in your 2 cents where relevant can steadily grow your credibility.• Optimal timing: Reddit activity peaks on weekdays during US business hours. For important posts, target morning to midday (ET) on a weekday. For example, posting around 9am–11am EST on Tuesday–Thursday can be ideal – users are active and your post has all day to accumulate upvotes ￼. Monday can work too (people browse Reddit at work), but there’s lots of weekend catch-up content then. Fridays slightly less activity in afternoons. Avoid late night postings (fewer users, and by morning your post is old news).• Consider time zone of the subreddit demographic – r/India or r/Europe subs might have different peak times. But for global ones, mid-day US covers Europe afternoon/evening and US morning, a good compromise.• Post lifespan: If a post doesn’t get traction in first 1–2 hours, it likely won’t; don’t repost immediately (that’s against rules). Instead, analyze and try a different angle another time. Each sub usually has a one-post-per-day (or per few days) unofficial limit for self-promotion content to avoid mod ire.• AMA timing: If doing an AMA, schedule it and announce ahead of time to get people to show up. Do it when you can be online answering for a few hours straight. Usually mid-week mid-day works, or early afternoon to also catch some after-work users. | • Content and tone: Redditors value honesty, detail, and utility. Write in a neutral, informative tone (avoid marketing language). Instead of “Our revolutionary app will save you time!”, say “I built a tool to automate parts of my workflow; here’s what it does and what I learned.” Be frank about pros and cons. Self-effacing humor can help (show you’re not taking yourself too seriously). Basically, be a Redditor first, a marketer second.• Titles matter: Craft post titles like Reddit headlines – either descriptive or intriguing. Example: “I used GPT-4 to handle all my customer support for a week – here’s what happened” or “Bootstrapped an AI SaaS to $1k MRR in 2 months by myself, AMA”. A good title gets clicks/upvotes; avoid sounding like clickbait or ad. Often phrasing as “I did X and this is what I learned” or asking a question to the community works well.• Subreddit etiquette: Lurk before posting. Each subreddit has norms. For instance, r/startups may allow sharing milestones with a certain format, r/MachineLearning disallows anything that looks like self-promotion or low-effort. Check sidebars for rules (some ban links, some require certain karma, etc.). Engage naturally: if a subreddit is very anti-promo, focus on pure informational content there. You can even ask mods if unsure (“Is it okay if I share a case study about my project? I’ll ensure it’s value-driven, not an ad.”). Better safe than banned.• Be responsive: If you post, stick around to reply to comments, especially in the first few hours. Reddit discussions can get lively – respond to questions, thank people for feedback (even critical feedback). If someone criticizes, respond gracefully or humorously, don’t get defensive (winning hearts of lurkers who see you handle critique well). ￼• Value-first, promotion-second: A good approach is to make your post useful even without clicking any link. Share the key insights or story in the text. You can mention your product in context (“…so I built an app called Pew Pew Prompts to solve this”). If the content is good, people will naturally ask for the link or check your profile. Some might even direct message you. You can always put a link in the comments if not in the post body (some subs prefer that). The mantra: give before you ask. ￼ ￼• Leverage high-karma accounts: If possible, use an account that has some history (if your personal Reddit account has karma, use that to post; or build karma by general participation before dropping your own posts). Brand-new accounts posting a promotion get ignored or removed often. Being a known quantity (even mildly) helps.• Monitor mentions: Set up Google Alerts or just periodically search Reddit for “Pew Pew Prompts” or relevant keywords. Sometimes users might mention your app or ask for AI tool suggestions – you can jump in and engage (e.g., if someone asks “Has anyone used Pew Pew Prompts?”, you definitely want to be there to respond/help). This is also a way to gather feedback from discussions you didn’t start. |
