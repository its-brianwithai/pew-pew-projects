| Indie Hackers   | • Milestone updates (posts celebrating or reflecting on key milestones – revenue benchmarks, launch anniversaries, user counts, etc. These often get traction on IH when framed as “I achieved X, here’s how”)• Building in public updates (regular journal-like entries about your project’s progress – could be weekly or monthly “Update #X” sharing what you built, metrics, what’s next. IH members often follow such series)• How-to/Advice articles (long-form posts that read like blog articles, but posted on IH forum – e.g., “How I gained my first 100 users” or “Lessons learned from a failed marketing experiment”. These provide value to others and spark discussion)• Questions for the community (“Discuss” posts where you solicit advice or opinions, e.g., “What’s the best way you’ve found to market an AI tool?” – engages others and also gets you insights)• AMA posts or interviews (less common unless arranged by IH, but you can do an informal “Hi, I’m building X, happy to share details or answer questions” in a relevant group like “Growth” or “Feedback”) | • Personal profile feed: On IndieHackers.com, each member has a timeline. When you post (discussion, milestone, etc.), it shows up on your profile and in the community feed. Ensure your profile is filled with your project info and a link to your site.• Indie Hackers groups/categories: Use tags like #BuildingInPublic, #Growth, #Bootstrapping, #Launches, #AMA when posting to target certain sections of the community. For example, a technical insight might be tagged #Tech, a revenue milestone tagged #Money or #Growth. This helps the right people find your post.• Product page: If you list “Pew Pew Prompts” as a product on IH (via the Products section), you can post milestones or updates on that product page. Those updates can appear in the IH feed and in the Products section for people browsing. It’s a good way to have all your journey updates in one place (and IH often showcases interesting milestone posts on the homepage).• Comment on others’ posts: Be active in commenting on other founders’ posts. If someone shares “Just hit $500 MRR with my SaaS”, congratulate and relate (maybe mention you’re in AI and just starting out). Giving feedback on someone’s landing page or answering a question in the forum also builds your presence. The more you engage, the more familiar people will be when they see your posts.• IH Newsletter/features: Not a direct posting channel, but note: particularly interesting forum posts often get featured in the Indie Hackers newsletter or tweeted by @IndieHackers. A well-written story or milestone could be picked up, amplifying reach. Aim for that quality and storytelling in your content. | • Frequency: You don’t need to post daily on IH. A meaningful update perhaps every 1–2 weeks is a good cadence. Many do weekly “journal” updates; others post when there’s news. Find a sustainable rhythm – e.g., a mid-month progress report and an end-of-month recap.• Timing: The IH community is global but with a lot of US and Europe members. Posting on weekdays tends to get more engagement than weekends. Within weekdays, morning to midday (US time) is good – say 9am–12pm ET (which is afternoon in Europe). That way your post is fresh when people browse during work breaks or early evening. IH doesn’t move as fast as Twitter, but posts do get buried after a day or two by newer ones, so timing to catch that day’s eyeballs helps.• Consistency: If you choose a specific day for recurring updates (e.g., every Friday you post a “week in review”), stick to it; you might build a following who looks forward to it. But make sure to also engage on others’ content regularly (multiple times a week) to maintain visibility and relationships.• Monitoring: Check IH daily or a few times a week for any comments on your posts and to see what discussions are trending – you might jump in those as well. Being a regular participant (even when you’re not posting new topics) keeps you on the community’s radar. | • Tone: IH is friendly, supportive, and candid. Be open about your journey – share both wins and struggles. The community resonates with authenticity (e.g., “I only got 3 signups this week, feeling a bit discouraged – has anyone else faced slow growth early on?” can get supportive and helpful responses). Avoid any hard-sell language; you’re a peer, not a marketer there.• Depth and detail: When sharing milestones or lessons, include numbers, strategies, tools you used. IH readers love concrete details (e.g., “I posted on Product Hunt and got 100 upvotes, which led to 200 site visits and 50 signups”). If you used your own prompt techniques in marketing, mention that (“I even used our own AI prompt tool to draft the copy – meta, I know 😅”). It not only validates your product in context, but also feels less like promotion and more like part of the story.• Ask and ye shall receive: Don’t shy from asking the community for specific feedback (“Would love input on my landing page – does the value prop make sense to you?”). Indie Hackers enjoy giving advice. Just be sure to also give back – if people comment, respond and perhaps incorporate their advice and later update them (“I changed my headline as you suggested and saw conversions go up 10% – thank you!”). This closing the loop fosters goodwill.• Cross-linking: You can reference your IH posts on other platforms for additional social proof. E.g., tweet “Just shared a detailed update on how we got our first 100 users on @IndieHackers – [link].” Some Twitter folks might click and discover your journey on IH, and IH likes when their content is shared externally. Conversely, if you wrote a great blog post, you can either post the full text on IH (for discussion) or share it as a link with a summary. Generally, posting full content natively gets more discussion on IH than just a link out.• Repurpose IH content: Your Indie Hackers posts (which are often informal blog posts) can double as content for your own blog or newsletter. After a good discussion, consider writing “What I learned from fellow indie hackers about X” and share that back on IH or elsewhere, giving shoutouts. This creates a nice content loop and shows you value the community’s input.• Networking: Treat IH as a networking platform too. If someone consistently comments on your posts, or you admire another founder’s journey, connect with them (IH has DM, or move to Twitter/LinkedIn). These connections can lead to collaboration, cross-promotion, or just moral support. Being active and genuine on IH can indirectly open doors (e.g., someone might invite you on their podcast after seeing your posts). |

| Product Hunt    | • Main Product Launch: The day you hunt (launch) your product on PH is the big event. This includes the product listing (name, tagline, description, media) and the all-important “Maker’s Comment” (the first comment where you introduce yourself, tell the story, and provide any special info or thanks). This post type is one-time per major version or product.• Product Updates: Product Hunt allows makers to post updates on their product page after launch (like “We added Feature X” or “Now supporting integration Y”). These appear to followers of your product. Use these for significant improvements or news (but not for every tiny change).• Upcoming Page: Prior to launch, PH’s “Upcoming” feature lets you create a landing page on PH for your product where people can subscribe to be notified of launch. It’s not a post per se, but a way to gather interested users. Promoting your Upcoming page acts like a pre-launch content strategy (teasers, etc.).• Engagement in comments: On launch day and beyond, the best content you can have is responsive comments. Your replies to user comments on your product page (answering questions, thanking for feedback) effectively become content that others read. A lively comment section can attract more people to engage.• PH Discussions/Q&A: Product Hunt used to have a “Discussions” section for general posts (like ask questions to the community). It’s de-emphasized in current PH, but occasionally makers post questions or tips there. The ROI is lower than a product launch, but if you have a broad question (e.g., about marketing or a trend), you might get some responses from the PH community. Focus primarily on launches/updates though. | • Your Product’s PH page: This is the focal point. When launching, ensure your product page is complete: a catchy tagline (under 60 characters), a concise description, a gallery of images or a demo video, and relevant tags. This is where you’ll direct people on launch day. (e.g., producthunt.com/posts/pew-pew-prompts).• Launch timing: Schedule your post to go live at 12:01am PST on your chosen launch day for maximum time on the home page ￼. PH operates on Pacific Time daily cycles. Launching right at reset (or a few minutes after midnight Pacific) means you get the full 24 hours to accumulate upvotes and comments. ￼ Many top products do this (though if you can’t, early morning PST is second best).• Promotion on PH: Aside from your page, use PH features: join the Ship/Upcoming program to gather subscribers (if you have it, share that link in your newsletter or socials: “Follow us on PH for launch perks!”), and consider engaging with the PH community beforehand by commenting/upvoting other launches (people might notice your helpful presence and reciprocate interest on your launch).• External: On launch day, share the PH link widely (Twitter, LinkedIn, your email list, Slack groups) to drive traffic to PH. The PH algorithm values external traffic and genuine engagement (comments, not just blind upvotes). Be careful in phrasing externally – PH discourages directly asking for upvotes (don’t say “please upvote us”), instead say “We just launched on Product Hunt! We’d love your support – check it out and tell us what you think! [PH link]” ￼.• Communities & forums: Also share on relevant communities that it’s your PH launch day (many have dedicated threads for PH launches, e.g., some Slack workspaces or Facebook maker groups encourage sharing PH launches for support). However, do this within rule bounds (some subreddits have PH launch threads, etc.). It can rally initial momentum.• After launch: Keep an eye on PH for comments even after day 1. Also consider doing a follow-up post on PH if you have a major pivot or new product (PH allows re-launches if the product significantly changes or for new products). Just don’t do it too frequently – make it count. | • Frequency: Major launch: as needed – likely once for your initial product launch. Some makers do a second launch for a major update or a new feature set (e.g., launching “Pew Pew Prompts 2.0” or launching a separate course product) after months. But generally, reserve PH for big moments. You might plan 1 launch in Year 1, maybe another in Year 2 if appropriate. It’s a one-time spike in traffic each time.• Timing (day of week): There’s debate about best day – many say Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday are the prime days (high traffic on PH). Monday can work but sometimes many launches = more competition. Avoid major holidays. Also avoid days when huge tech companies launch something (your product can be overshadowed). If OpenAI or Apple has an event, maybe pick a different day.• PH launches are 24h marathons, especially the first half. Plan to be awake and active as much as possible during that cycle (if you’re in Europe launching at 12:01am PST, that’s 9am CET – actually convenient for you to cover whole workday and then some). The first few hours are critical to gather votes/comments that propel you up the homepage. After about 12-16 hours, rankings solidify, but still engage till the end.• Time investment: Leading up, spend time preparing (see Strategy). Post-launch, consider a retrospective IH or blog post (“We launched on PH, here’s how it went” – people love those breakdowns and it doubles as content/marketing). | • Pre-launch preparation: “Make your PH launch an event.” Build an email list or community beforehand (even a small one). A week before, tease on Twitter/LinkedIn that you’re launching on PH on X date. Personally invite friends/colleagues/early users to support (again, ask for feedback or to “join the discussion” rather than “upvote”). Having a Hunter (a PH community member who submits your product) isn’t required (PH now encourages makers to self-post). However, if a well-known hunter is willing, it can give slight extra exposure. More importantly, gather Product Hunt followers: people who click “Notify me” on your Upcoming page or follow you on PH will get notified – that base helps initial traction.• Maker’s Comment strategy: This is where you tell your story on launch day. Keep it concise, enthusiastic, and gratitude-oriented. Who you are, why you built this (“We were frustrated with X, so we made Y…”), what it does (brief bullet of key features/benefits), and end with a thank you and invitation (“PH community, we’d love your feedback or questions!”). Maybe mention any launch-day deals (e.g., “exclusive 20% off for PH users today” or a free tier/trial extension). A well-crafted first comment sets a positive tone and gives commenters talking points. ￼• Engage comments: Treat every commenter like gold. Reply to each by name, address their points, be positive and humble. If someone says “Cool idea, but I wish it did X,” respond with “Great point – we have X on our roadmap!” or ask them for more input. If there’s critique, acknowledge and explain (no defensiveness). An active comment section can influence onlookers to upvote because they see a responsive maker.• Leverage momentum: If you perform well (e.g., Product of the Day or in top 5), leverage that in marketing: social proof for your site (“#3 Product of the Day on Product Hunt” badge). Also, many tech news sites or newsletters monitor PH – a strong showing could get you press inquiries or mentions. Be ready with a press kit or at least an openness to capitalize on any outreach.• Post-launch follow-through: Take feedback from PH and implement what makes sense – then consider posting a Product Update on PH later (“Thanks for the feedback, we just launched 3 new features you asked for!”). This pings followers and shows you listen. Also, publicly thank the PH community (Twitter shoutout or IH post about the experience) – it’s good relationship building and acknowledges the support.• Don’t game, build relationships: Avoid any fakery (buying votes, etc. – PH algorithms can detect pods or sudden bursts from same IP region). It’s better to have 100 genuine supporters than 500 empty votes. Focus on the relationships: those early PH supporters might become your advocates. Invite them to join your newsletter or community to stay in touch. Product Hunt is not just a one-day thing; it can seed your initial user base which you can grow through other channels long-term. |

| SEO & Blog      | • Blog posts on your site (informational articles, listicles, tutorials – tailored to rank on Google and provide value to readers). These can be cornerstone long-form content or shorter timely posts.• Guest blog posts (articles you write for other sites’ blogs or Medium publications – extends reach and typically link back to your site, aiding SEO through backlinks).• SEO content updates (refreshing older blog posts with new info, better keywords, etc. – essentially “re-posting” improved content which can be seen as new by search engines).• Documentation/Guides (if your product has a docs section or knowledge base, maintaining SEO-optimized how-to guides or FAQs there can capture search traffic for support-type queries).• Medium/Dev.to cross-posts (syndicating your blog content on platforms like Medium, Dev.to, Hashnode for additional audience. Not new content per se, but a posting strategy to reuse content and capture those ecosystems). | • Your website’s Blog (e.g., pewpewprompts.com/blog). All major content should live here for SEO benefits. Organize by categories (e.g., “Prompt Tips”, “AI for Productivity”, “Building in Public”) so readers (and Google) see thematic consistency.• Medium: Consider creating a Medium profile for reposting articles (use the “Import” function to avoid duplicate content penalties by setting canonical link to your site). Also, pitch to relevant Medium publications (e.g., Towards Data Science, The Startup, Entrepreneur’s Handbook) – being published there can vastly increase readership. Include a bio with link to your site in guest posts.• Other blogs & forums: Identify industry blogs or newsletters that accept guest posts. For example, a popular AI newsletter or a site like Hackernoon, or even cross-post on IndieHackers blog section if they allow. Each guest post typically links back to your site, boosting SEO and referral traffic. Also answer Q&A on sites like Stack Overflow for Teams or Quora with links to your blog when relevant (as discussed in “Other Channels”).• SEO distribution: Ensure your blog content is indexed (submit sitemap to Google Search Console). Share your posts on social (Twitter, LinkedIn groups, etc.) to get initial traffic (which can help Google notice it sooner). Perhaps post on Hacker News or Reddit if the content suits (e.g., a high-value tutorial might do well on /r/MachineLearning or HN – but only if truly interesting to that crowd, not just for clicks).• On-site promotion: Within your site, promote the blog – e.g., link to latest posts from your homepage, or have a “Resources” section. You might also do a newsletter signup form on blog pages (“Enjoying this article? Join our newsletter for weekly AI tips!”) to convert readers into subscribers. | • Frequency: To gain SEO traction and keep readers engaged, aim for 1 new blog post per week (or at minimum 2–3 per month). Regular fresh content signals to search engines your site is active. Companies that increased blogging to ~16 posts/month saw significantly higher traffic and leads ￼. If alone, try weekly or biweekly posts that are high quality rather than daily mediocre posts.• Timing (when to publish): For SEO, the exact publish time isn’t critical (Google will find you regardless), but for maximizing human readership and social sharing: publish on weekday mornings. Many companies release blog posts on Tuesdays or Wednesdays around 9–11am. This gives time to share it on LinkedIn or Hacker News during peak engagement. Also, avoid publishing late Friday or on weekends if you want people to notice immediately (tech audiences often catch up on content during weekdays).• Keep a content calendar: plan out topics in advance (tie them to product launches, seasonal trends, or SEO keyword gaps). Consistency is key: if weekly, try same day each week so followers know (e.g., every Wednesday a new article).• Monitoring & updating: Check your Google Analytics or Search Console data monthly – see which posts get traffic and which keywords you’re ranking for. Update top posts every few months (improve them, add current info) to maintain/improve rankings. You can also consolidate low-performing posts (turn two thin posts into one comprehensive post) to boost SEO value. | • Keyword strategy: Do keyword research for each post. Use tools (Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, etc.) to find terms like “AI prompt tips”, “how to improve ChatGPT output”, “best AI tools for startups”. Target one primary keyword per post and a few secondary ones. Incorporate these naturally in the title, headers, and body. For example, a post titled “How to Write Better ChatGPT Prompts (and 5 Examples)” targets “write better ChatGPT prompts” which people search. The content then delivers on that intent, increasing chances of ranking and being shared.• Quality content: Aim for posts that are in-depth, practical, and well-formatted. Use headings, bullet points, images, and maybe embedded videos (like your YouTube tutorials) to enrich posts. The goal is to be the piece of content that thoroughly answers the reader’s question or need. If someone searches “AI for productivity tips” and your post gives them 10 actionable tips with examples, they’ll stay on page (good for SEO) and possibly convert to trying your product. Google also uses engagement metrics (time on site, etc.) indirectly. ￼ ￼• CTAs in posts: Don’t shy from including calls-to-action, but make them relevant and soft. E.g., after a post on prompt tips, “If you found these tips useful, consider checking out our AI Prompt course for a deeper dive (link).” Or mid-article, a sidebar “Try our free prompt generator – it implements tip #3 automatically!”. Conversion from blog to user is part of the strategy. Just ensure CTAs are a small part of a content-rich page (Google won’t rank you if it’s salesy with thin content).• Link strategy: Internally link between your posts (“As mentioned in our guide to AI productivity ￼, …”). This helps SEO and keeps readers on your site. Also, link out to authoritative sources when appropriate (e.g., citing a statistic from Gartner). Outbound links to good sources can build credibility in the eyes of readers (and possibly search engines). Just don’t overdo or link to competitors too directly.• Promotion beyond SEO: Share each blog post everywhere relevant (we mentioned social, communities). Also consider reaching out personally to a few people who might enjoy it (e.g., someone who asked a question your post answers – “Hey, I remember you asked about X, we just published a detailed guide on it, thought you might find useful!” – genuine, 1:1 content marketing). Early traction can sometimes lead to others linking your post, which is gold for SEO.• Evergreen vs News: Balance evergreen content (that stays relevant, great for SEO long-term) with timely pieces (that can get a short-term traffic spike or shares if about a current event). E.g., an evergreen post: “Prompt Engineering 101 – Basics for Beginners”. A timely post: “OpenAI’s Latest Update – What It Means for Prompt Writers [August 2025]”. The latter might get a surge via social/news, the former will quietly accumulate traffic via search over months. Both valuable. Repurpose timely ones later by updating them into evergreen references if possible (“In Aug 2025, X happened… now here’s the lasting impact”).• Lead magnets: Consider creating some downloadable content via your blog (like “Free PDF: 50 Prompt Ideas for Busy Founders”). Offer it within relevant posts or as a pop-up. This can supercharge newsletter sign-ups. It’s content marketing 101: give a high-value freebie in exchange for an email. Make sure it’s truly useful and relevant so the quality of leads is high (people interested in prompts will join). |

| Newsletters     | • Regular email newsletter (HTML or plain text) – typically structured with a mix of original content and curated links. E.g., an intro paragraph, a list of tips or news, and maybe a personal sign-off. This is the core “post” type delivered to inboxes on your chosen schedule.• Automated email sequences (if someone signs up, maybe they get a short welcome series – not exactly “content posts” but part of newsletter strategy to warm new subscribers with best content or an intro of your brand).• Newsletter-exclusive content – occasionally send a special edition (like a “subscriber-only” deep dive or a Q&A interview) to reward subscribers. It differentiates the newsletter from public content.• Promotional emails – once in a while, an email focusing on your product (launch announcement, sale, new course module) – should be used sparingly among the regular value emails.• Digest emails – if you have a lot of content, an email that curates “Top community posts of the month” or “Best links I found this week” in AI/indie hacking. Readers appreciate you filtering noise for them. | • Email platform: Use a reliable newsletter platform (e.g., Substack, Mailchimp, ConvertKit, etc.). Substack doubles as a posting platform (people can read on the web too). Others are primarily email. Ensure you have a clean email template that is mobile-friendly (a majority will read on phone).• Sending domain: Set up your own domain for sending (for professionalism and deliverability, e.g., newsletter@pewpewprompts.com). Warm it up by sending consistent volumes and ask subscribers to whitelist if necessary.• Signup channels: Promote the newsletter on all platforms: link in bio on socials (“✉️ Join our AI newsletter”), a banner or popup on your website (“Join 500+ readers…”). Possibly offer an incentive like a free mini ebook or cheat sheet for signing up (as mentioned in blog strategy).• Where content lives: Each newsletter issue can also live on a web archive (if using Substack or Revue). If not built-in, consider posting the content to your blog after a period (“Newsletter Issue #10 archive”) for those who missed it and for SEO benefit. But some keep it exclusive to encourage sign-ups. Decide if you want a public archive or subscriber-only content. Many do a mix (e.g., latest issue for subscribers only, older issues open).• Cross-promotion: Partner with adjacent newsletters for shoutouts or ad swaps. For example, a newsletter about productivity might mention yours if you mention theirs – a great way to grow audience organically. Also plug your newsletter in relevant communities (“I run a free weekly AI tips newsletter, link in my profile”). Just always frame it as beneficial (“curated tips”) not as an ad.• List management: As your list grows, segment if needed (e.g., founders vs AI enthusiasts, if you gather that info) to target content. In early stages, one list for all is fine. Periodically clean the list (remove or re-engage cold subscribers) to keep open rates high and avoid spam traps. | • Frequency: Weekly is often the sweet spot for newsletters. It’s frequent enough to build a relationship but not so frequent as to overwhelm (assuming you have valuable content each time). Many successful newsletters in tech are weekly or biweekly. If bandwidth allows, do weekly – say every Tuesday or Thursday. Consistency (day and time) trains readers and also lets you plan content rhythm.• If weekly is too much initially, start biweekly (2x a month). Avoid months-long gaps – people forget and are likely to ignore or unsubscribe when you pop up sporadically. Consistency also helps with deliverability (email providers see a regular pattern).• Ideal send time: Studies show mid-week (Tue, Wed, Thu) mid-morning tends to yield high open rates ￼. For example, sending at 10am Eastern on Wednesday could hit morning for Americas and afternoon for Europe, a good balance (if those are your audiences). Experiment – some newsletters find their audience engages better at 7am (people read at breakfast) or in the evening. But generally, avoid Friday p.m. (weekend slump) and Mondays early (inbox overload). Tuesday or Wednesday around 10am is a safe starting point ￼.• Check your subscriber base geography: if significant in Europe, maybe send a bit earlier; if mostly US West Coast, maybe late morning Pacific (which is early afternoon Eastern). You can also segment send times by timezone if your platform supports it.• Cadence adjustments: If content is light, it’s okay to occasionally skip a week (better to skip than send fluff). Just be transparent if possible (“we’ll be back next week with a big issue on X!”). But try not to skip often – routine is key to keep people engaged.• Monitor metrics: Aim for at least a 30% open rate to start (as list grows it might drop into 20-25%, which is still ok). If open rates are falling, it could be frequency issue or content relevance – adjust accordingly (or prune the list of inactive subscribers). Click-through rate will vary based on how many links/CTAs, but measure what content gets clicks (that tells you what readers care about). | • Tone & style: Write as if to a friend – newsletters work best when they feel personal. Use a warm, conversational tone, perhaps even more intimate than your blog. It can still be professional in content, but use “I” and “you” a lot. e.g., “Hi everyone, hope your week’s going well. I want to share a cool prompt experiment I tried…”. Many newsletter readers like feeling part of an inner circle.• Structure: Keep a consistent structure so readers know what to expect. For example: Intro anecdote or insight (1-2 paragraphs) -> Main content (could be one big tip or a few short tips or curated finds) -> Conclusion/CTA. Numbered lists or sections with clear headings can help scanning. If you have multiple sections (e.g., “📰 AI News, 💡 Prompt Tip of the Week, 🔗 Tool Recommendations”), use emojis or sub-headings for each – makes it visually appealing and easy to jump to sections of interest.• Value first, marketing second: Ensure every issue provides clear value (a new tip, a roundup of news, a thoughtful analysis). That builds trust such that when you occasionally promote your product or course, readers are fine with it. A common ratio is 3 or 4 purely value-packed emails for every 1 promotional email. Even promotional emails should have some value (e.g., explaining why a new feature helps them, not just “buy now”).• Calls to action: In a regular issue, your CTA might be subtle: “P.S. We’re building Pew Pew Prompts in public – if you haven’t tried it yet, we’d love you on board (free plan is available!).” In a dedicated promo email, it’s more direct: “Enroll in our course with a 20% subscriber discount – link here.” Also, invite engagement: “Reply to this email and let me know your biggest AI workflow challenge.” Newsletters can be two-way; reader replies can spark conversations or future content ideas, and higher reply rates can even improve deliverability (email providers see it as important if people respond).• Visuals in email: A few images or GIFs can add character (maybe a meme at the end or a diagram illustrating a point). But don’t overdo – too many images can trigger spam filters or just clutter the email. And ensure it looks okay in dark mode (some email clients invert colors). Test your email on mobile and desktop before sending.• Growth & referral: Once you have some happy readers, consider adding a referral incentive – e.g., “Refer 5 friends to the newsletter and get a exclusive Prompt Cheat Sheet.” There are tools for referral tracking (SparkLoop, etc.). This can organically grow your audience as current readers vouch for you. Even without formal program, occasionally ask “If you enjoy this newsletter, forward it to a friend who’d find it useful!” – a simple ask can go a long way.• Integration with other content: Use the newsletter to amplify everything else. Announce new blog posts (“In case you missed, we wrote about X – link below.”), YouTube videos (“📺 Just uploaded a new tutorial – check it out here.”), or even summarize great points from a Reddit discussion you started. It ties your ecosystem together and ensures your core fans don’t miss anything. Conversely, you can take unique content from the newsletter and repurpose on socials (“In our last newsletter, we shared 3 tools, here’s one… for the rest join the newsletter.”). This way, each channel feeds others in a virtuous cycle. |

| Other Channels(Quora, HN, FB Groups, etc.) | • Q&A Answers: Writing comprehensive answers on Quora (or Stack Exchange sites) that address users’ questions. Essentially mini blog posts tailored to the question, often with an option to include links or examples (like linking your relevant blog post or mentioning your tool if relevant). The goal is to be the “top answer” which can get thousands of views over time.• Forum participation: Engaging in niche communities (could be older-style forums, or modern ones like Reddit which we covered, or Slack/Discord communities). Not posting articles per se, but making helpful posts or starting threads that share knowledge. For instance, a post on a Facebook Group “AI Entrepreneurs” sharing a tip or asking a question to spark discussion.• Hacker News submissions: Either “Show HN” (when you have something to show like your project or a cool demo – format: “Show HN: [Product Name] – [One-line description]”) or sharing a link to a blog post with a compelling title. The content is usually an external link, but the “post” on HN is that link with your title and then the comments section. Being active in those comments is crucial if it takes off.• Cross-posting to dev communities: For instance, posting an article on Dev.to (developer community) if you have technical how-tos (Dev.to has an editor much like blogging). Or sharing insights on LinkedIn Groups or Slack channels (like #random or #resources in entrepreneur Slack workspaces) – not formal “posts” but part of content strategy to spread knowledge of your brand.• Answering comments on others’ content: E.g., on YouTube videos about AI (not your own) – leaving a thoughtful comment can draw interest to you, or on Twitter threads – being visible as an expert by consistently contributing. This is more subtle but part of omnipresent content strategy. | • Quora: Focus on topics relevant to your domain. E.g., follow topics like Artificial Intelligence, Prompt Engineering, Startups, Productivity Hacks. When you answer, use Quora’s formatting (bullet points, bold for key phrases) to make it readable. Include images if helpful (e.g., you can attach an image of a prompt result or a graph). Link to your own content sparingly – ideally only when it provides extra value (Quora may collapse answers that are pure self-promo). A good approach is to give a complete answer, then at the end cite a source or “For a full step-by-step guide, I wrote an article here  ￼.” Many Quora answers rank on Google, so these can be long-term traffic drivers.• Hacker News: Only post content that truly fits the HN audience (which skews tech-savvy, skeptical of marketing). If you have a blog post that is educational (not salesy) or a demo, craft a clear title for HN. E.g., if sharing your blog “10 AI prompts for productivity”, HN title might be “Ask HN: What are your best AI productivity prompts?” (as a discussion) or better, share something more technical from your blog like “We built an AI to automate our tasks – here’s what we learned” which reads more like an interesting story/case study. Also, be an active HN user beyond your own posts – comment on other HN posts with insights (this builds hacker credibility).• Facebook & LinkedIn Groups: Identify a few active groups. On Facebook, for instance, “Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning” or “SaaS Founders” etc. Observe group rules (some ban promo, some have specific days for sharing content). Provide value: maybe post a question that also shares something (“I tried [XYZ AI tool] to speed up my coding. Has anyone else done similar?” – sparks discussion). You can mention your product in context if allowed, but often it’s better to focus on problems/solutions generally. On LinkedIn, groups are less lively, but you can still post articles or questions – just don’t expect huge engagement, yet it can’t hurt to repurpose a post there for any extra eyes.• Discord/Slack: Join servers like WIP (WorkInProgress), Indie Worldwide, or any AI-focused Discord (there are a few for prompt enthusiasts or OpenAI developers). In Slack, communities like Indie Hackers Slack, NoCode Founders, etc. Be a helpful member – answer others’ questions, share useful tools (not just yours). Perhaps host a casual “office hours” in a Discord if the community does events. The key is relationship building – people might check out your profile or ask for your link after seeing you help often.• Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange: If there are specific technical questions (e.g., on Stack Overflow about using OpenAI API or on Artificial Intelligence Stack Exchange about prompt techniques), answer them thoroughly. Direct promotion is not allowed, but you can often reference your own library or solution if it genuinely addresses the question (with transparency of affiliation). For example, if someone asks how to format prompts, you could answer and mention “I created a small tool to do X (open-source or available on my site) which implements this approach.” Stack Exchange answers can’t have marketing slant – they must be objective/techni‍cal. | • Frequency: Quora: aim to answer a couple of questions per week (even 1-2 high-quality answers weekly can accumulate views – some top writers answer daily, but find a sustainable frequency). Identify questions with many followers but few good answers – those are golden ￼. Even older unanswered questions are fine to answer; Quora will resurface them.• Hacker News: don’t post too often – a self-submitted story more than once a month might be too much unless you have genuinely different valuable content. Instead, be active in comments almost daily if possible (HN has high volume of interesting stories). If you become a familiar username adding insightful comments, people will naturally be curious about your work.• Facebook/Discord, etc.: These you can engage more casually/frequently. Perhaps aim for daily lightweight engagement (commenting, reacting) and weekly deeper engagement (starting a conversation or sharing a resource). E.g., each week share one useful thing in one of your groups/communities. Rotate through them so you’re not spamming one place. This keeps you on the radar across multiple channels without exhausting you.• Monitoring timing: For Q&A sites and HN, being early can matter. E.g., an early answer on Quora (before others answer) can get more upvotes if it’s good. So maybe set alerts or check regularly for new questions in your topics. Similarly, on HN, commenting when a thread is fresh (and likely to hit front page) means your comment is seen by more. This is hard to time perfectly, but being generally active increases the chance.• Time of day: Quora and forums aren’t as real-time, but posting when people are likely browsing helps (Quora users often browse in evenings or weekends for example). For Facebook/Discord chats, evenings (after work) or around lunch can see more chatter. If you post a question at 3am, you might get buried by morning chatter in Slack. So post when folks are around (afternoon/evening in the group’s primary timezone).• Long-term consistency: These channels often have slow burn ROI. A Quora answer from 3 months ago might suddenly go viral or rank on Google and bring traffic daily. So keep at it consistently; results compound over time. | • Value & credibility: On these “other” channels, you are often an individual voice rather than a brand. Establish credibility by being genuinely helpful and knowledgeable. Over time, people might start tagging you (“Maybe @YourName can answer this, they know about AI prompts”). That’s the reputation goal – to be seen as an expert/resource. This happens by consistently good contributions without overt self-promo in every post.• Soft promotion: You can promote, but softly. For example, on Quora put a one-liner about you in your profile (“Founder of Pew Pew Prompts – AI productivity tools”) – Quora shows a snippet of your bio under your answers, so every answer subtly carries your brand. In answers, if relevant, say “Disclosure: I built a tool that does X, but even if not using that, you can [provide generic solution].” Transparency is appreciated and doesn’t usually draw ire if the content is useful.• Build relationships: If someone interacts often (comments on your Quora answer appreciatively, or a person in a FB group always responds to your posts), consider reaching out via DM to thank them or continue the convo. These one-on-one connections can turn into advocates or collaborators. For instance, an active IH member might become a beta user or a partner for a joint webinar, etc.• Time management: These channels can be a rabbit hole. It helps to allocate, say, 30 minutes a day to “community engagement” where you scan and answer on various forums. Use tools: set up Google Alerts for your product name or relevant keywords, use a tool like F5Bot to get notified when keywords are mentioned on Reddit/HN, etc., so you can jump in timely. But don’t let it derail core work; treat it as an important but scheduled part of marketing.• Content repurposing across channels: An insightful Quora answer you wrote can be repurposed into a blog post (expand it, polish and publish on your site, since you own the content). Vice versa, a great blog post can be summarized as an answer to a Quora question (with link to full post). A handy trick: sometimes ask a question on Quora that you want to answer, using a secondary account or anonymously, then answer it with your main account thoroughly (this is a known growth hack). Just ensure the question is genuine and not obviously planted. Similarly, on forums, you can initiate discussions on topics that lead into sharing what you’ve learned (subtly highlighting your expertise/product). Essentially, if a conversation isn’t happening, you can start it.• Watching for opportunities: Keep an ear out in communities for pain points you solve. If someone in a FB group asks “Anyone know how to manage prompts better? I keep losing track,” that’s your moment to politely mention your solution: “I had the same issue, which is partly why I built Pew Pew Prompts – it helps organize them. Happy to give you a free trial to see if it helps.” Tailor the pitch to be helpful and not just sales. In communities, offering something free or being very non-pushy goes a long way. People might actually invite you to share more if you approach it as helping.• Measuring impact: Track referral traffic from these channels (UTM parameters or just keeping an eye on analytics). It can be tricky since a lot might be “dark social” (e.g., someone sees you on Discord then directly visits your site later). But qualitatively, you’ll notice if more users mention “I found you on Quora” or similar. Ask new signups in a quick survey “How did you hear about us?” to capture that data. Double down on channels that consistently show up. |
