# 📝 Feedback: PLX Framework Configuration System
> 💡 *Constructive feedback for improving the PLX framework's configuration management capabilities. This feedback will be processed by the appropriate meta agent to enhance the framework.*

## 🎯 Component Details
> 💡 *Identify the specific component and its location within the PLX framework.*

**Component Type:** Framework Infrastructure
**Component Name:** PLX Configuration System (currently non-existent)
**File Path:** `N/A - Feature request for new component`
**Version/Last Modified:** N/A - New feature request

## 📊 Context & Usage
> 💡 *Describe how you were using this component when you identified areas for improvement.*

**Use Case:** Attempting to customize PLX framework behavior for project-specific needs, including setting default directories for feedback documents, configuring naming conventions, and establishing project-specific settings
**Interaction Type:** Framework configuration and customization
**Related Components:** All PLX components that generate files or need configurable behavior (agents, templates, workflows, prompts, feedback system)

## 🔍 Observations
> 💡 *Document specific behaviours, outputs, or characteristics that prompted this feedback.*

### What Worked Well
- The framework has clear conventions and patterns
- Scripts are well-organized and modular
- Makefile provides good command structure

### Areas for Improvement
- **Issue:** No centralized configuration system exists
  - **Example:** Feedback documents always go to `feedback/` with hardcoded naming patterns
  - **Impact:** Users cannot customize framework behavior without modifying core scripts
- **Issue:** Naming conventions are scattered across multiple scripts
  - **Example:** Each sync script has its own naming logic
  - **Impact:** Difficult to maintain consistency or customize patterns
- **Issue:** Directory locations are hardcoded throughout the codebase
  - **Example:** `.claude/`, `feedback/`, `drafts/` paths are fixed
  - **Impact:** Cannot adapt to different project structures or preferences
- **Issue:** No user-specific overrides mechanism
  - **Example:** Team members can't have personal preferences
  - **Impact:** One-size-fits-all approach limits flexibility

## 💡 Suggestions
> 💡 *Provide specific, actionable suggestions for improving this component.*

1. **Create a Hierarchical Configuration System**
   - **Current State:** No configuration file exists
   - **Proposed Change:** Implement `.plxconfig.yaml` with optional `.plxconfig.local.yaml` for overrides
   - **Rationale:** Provides flexibility while maintaining defaults
   - **Implementation Notes:** YAML format for readability, support environment variable expansion

2. **Centralize Directory Configuration**
   - **Current State:** Paths hardcoded in scripts
   - **Proposed Change:** All directory paths configurable in config file
   - **Rationale:** Allows projects to adapt PLX to their structure
   - **Implementation Notes:** Support both relative and absolute paths

3. **Implement Naming Convention Templates**
   - **Current State:** Fixed naming patterns in scripts
   - **Proposed Change:** Template-based naming with variables like `{{component-type}}`, `{{date}}`, `{{timestamp}}`
   - **Rationale:** Customizable while maintaining consistency
   - **Implementation Notes:** Use simple string replacement or template engine

4. **Add Framework Behavior Settings**
   - **Current State:** Behavior is hardcoded (e.g., clean sync, watch directories)
   - **Proposed Change:** Configurable options for sync behavior, watch settings, git integration
   - **Rationale:** Different projects have different needs
   - **Implementation Notes:** Include sensible defaults for all settings

5. **Support Integration Configurations**
   - **Current State:** No external integration support
   - **Proposed Change:** Configuration sections for GitHub, Slack, other tools
   - **Rationale:** Modern workflows need integrations
   - **Implementation Notes:** Optional sections with enable/disable flags

## 🎨 Examples & Comparisons
> 💡 *If helpful, provide examples of desired behavior or reference similar components that handle things well.*

### Desired Behaviour Example
```yaml
# .plxconfig.yaml
directories:
  feedback: docs/feedback/  # Custom feedback location
  claude_sync: .ai/claude/   # Custom sync directory

naming:
  feedback: "{{date}}-{{component-type}}-{{component-name}}.md"
  date_format: "%Y-%m-%d"

claude_sync:
  clean_by_default: true
  watch:
    enabled: true
    directories:
      - src/agents/
      - src/prompts/
```

### Reference Implementation
- Component: Popular CLI tools like ESLint, Prettier, Jest
- Relevant Pattern: Hierarchical config with `.rc` files, local overrides, and sensible defaults

## 📋 Meta Agent Assignment
> 💡 *Indicate which meta agent should process this feedback.*

**Recommended Meta Agent:** [[meta-workflow-specialist]]
**Reasoning:** This is a framework-wide architectural change that affects multiple components and requires sophisticated orchestration of configuration loading, validation, and application across the entire PLX ecosystem

## 📝 Additional Notes
> 💡 *Any other context, considerations, or information that might be helpful.*

The configuration system should be designed with these principles:
- **Convention over configuration** - Everything should work with zero config
- **Progressive disclosure** - Simple use cases need simple config
- **Backward compatibility** - Existing projects should continue working
- **Security** - Sensitive data should go in `.local` files that are gitignored
- **Validation** - Config should be validated on load with helpful error messages
- **Documentation** - Each config option should be well-documented with examples

This is a foundational feature that will make PLX more flexible and easier to adopt across different projects and teams. The lack of configuration is currently a significant limitation that forces users to either accept defaults or fork the framework.
