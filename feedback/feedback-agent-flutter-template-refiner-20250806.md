# 📝 Feedback: Flutter Template Refiner Agent

> 💡 *Constructive feedback for improving a specific PLX framework component. This feedback will be processed by the appropriate meta agent to enhance the framework.*

## 🎯 Component Details
> 💡 *Identify the specific component and its location within the PLX framework.*

**Component Type:** Agent
**Component Name:** Flutter Template Refiner
**File Path:** `agents/dev/flutter-template-refiner.md` (if it exists)
**Version/Last Modified:** Current session - August 6, 2025

## 📊 Context & Usage
> 💡 *Describe how you were using this component when you identified areas for improvement.*

**Use Case:** Attempting to refine a Flutter application into a clean template by progressively removing application-specific features
**Interaction Type:** Direct usage via slash command `/act:flutter-template-refiner`
**Related Components:** None identified

## 🔍 Observations
> 💡 *Document specific behaviours, outputs, or characteristics that prompted this feedback.*

### What Worked Well
- Comprehensive analysis of the project structure
- Good identification of removable features vs core template features
- Detailed removal specifications with clear steps

### Areas for Improvement
- **Issue:** Agent included unnecessary branching strategy in the workflow
  - **Example:** Agent proposed creating feature branches like `remove-feature-tasks` for each removal
  - **Impact:** Adds unnecessary complexity to the refinement process when working directly on template-refactor branch is sufficient
- **Issue:** Overly complex Git workflow for simple template refinement
  - **Example:** Multiple branches, PRs, and review cycles for each feature removal
  - **Impact:** Slows down the refinement process significantly

## 💡 Suggestions
> 💡 *Provide specific, actionable suggestions for improving this component.*

1. **Simplify Version Control Strategy**
   - **Current State:** Agent creates feature branches for each removal, implements PR workflow
   - **Proposed Change:** Work directly on a single template-refactor branch without sub-branches
   - **Rationale:** Template refinement is typically a solo activity that doesn't need complex branching
   - **Implementation Notes:** Update Step 5 and Step 8 in the agent instructions to remove branching requirements

2. **Make Workflow Configurable**
   - **Current State:** Branching strategy is hardcoded into the agent's workflow
   - **Proposed Change:** Allow users to specify their preferred workflow (simple vs branching)
   - **Rationale:** Different teams have different needs - some may want branches, others may not
   - **Implementation Notes:** Add a parameter or initial question about workflow preference

## 🎨 Examples & Comparisons
> 💡 *If helpful, provide examples of desired behavior or reference similar components that handle things well.*

### Desired Behaviour Example
```
When user says "no need for branching strategy":
- Agent acknowledges and adjusts workflow
- All subsequent removals happen directly on template-refactor branch
- Commits are made after each successful removal
- No PRs or feature branches are created
```

### Reference Implementation

## 🚀 Priority & Impact Assessment
> 💡 *Help prioritize this feedback by assessing its importance and impact.*

**Priority Level:** Medium
**Scope of Impact:** Single component
**User Impact:** Makes the agent more flexible and efficient for different workflow preferences
**Implementation Effort:** Quick fix - just needs adjustment to workflow steps

## 📋 Meta Agent Assignment
> 💡 *Indicate which meta agent should process this feedback.*

**Recommended Meta Agent:** [[meta-sub-agent-architect]]
**Reasoning:** This feedback relates to agent design and workflow patterns, which is the specialty of the sub-agent architect

## 📝 Additional Notes
> 💡 *Any other context, considerations, or information that might be helpful.*

The agent's core functionality is excellent - it just needs to be less prescriptive about version control workflows. The detailed analysis and removal specifications are very thorough and useful. The issue is purely about the assumed Git workflow being too complex for the typical use case of template refinement.
