# 📝 Feedback: Discovery Phase Actor and Component Differentiation
> 💡 *Constructive feedback for improving how the PLX framework differentiates between system actors, human actors, and components during discovery and planning phases.*

## 🎯 Component Details
> 💡 *Identify the specific component and its location within the PLX framework.*

**Component Type:** Multiple (Agents, Prompts, Context)
**Component Name:** Discovery Agent and related planning components
**File Path:** `agents/discovery/discovery-agent.md`, `context/` directory patterns
**Version/Last Modified:** Current as of 2025-08-05

## 📊 Context & Usage
> 💡 *Describe how you were using this component when you identified areas for improvement.*

**Use Case:** During discovery phase when identifying stakeholders and system components for feature planning
**Interaction Type:** Direct usage of discovery workflows and context documentation
**Related Components:** [[discovery-agent]], [[requirements-agent]], context documentation templates

## 🔍 Observations
> 💡 *Document specific behaviours, outputs, or characteristics that prompted this feedback.*

### What Worked Well
- The discovery process effectively identifies entities involved in the system
- Context documentation provides good structure for capturing information

### Areas for Improvement
- **Issue:** Lack of clear differentiation between different types of actors
  - **Example:** When documenting a feature, "User" could mean end-user (human), system user (service account), or component acting on behalf of a user
  - **Impact:** Creates ambiguity in requirements and can lead to misunderstandings about who/what is performing actions
- **Issue:** Components are sometimes treated as actors without clear distinction
  - **Example:** A "Payment Service" might be listed as an actor alongside "Customer" without clarifying one is system/component and other is human
  - **Impact:** Makes it difficult to understand interaction patterns and design appropriate interfaces

## 💡 Suggestions
> 💡 *Provide specific, actionable suggestions for improving this component.*

1. **Introduce Actor Type Classification**
   - **Current State:** All actors are listed without type differentiation
   - **Proposed Change:** Categorize actors explicitly as:
     - **Human Actors:** End users, administrators, support staff
     - **System Actors:** External services, APIs, automated processes
     - **Components:** Internal system modules, services, libraries
   - **Rationale:** Clear categorization helps in understanding interaction patterns and designing appropriate interfaces
   - **Implementation Notes:** Could be implemented through:
     - Separate sections in discovery documentation
     - Prefixes or tags (e.g., [HUMAN], [SYSTEM], [COMPONENT])
     - Different formatting or emoji indicators

2. **Update Discovery Agent Instructions**
   - **Current State:** Discovery agent identifies actors without explicit typing
   - **Proposed Change:** Add explicit instructions to categorize and differentiate actor types during discovery
   - **Rationale:** Ensures consistent identification and documentation across all uses
   - **Implementation Notes:** Update discovery-agent.md with classification guidelines

3. **Create Actor/Component Template**
   - **Current State:** No standardized template for documenting actors and components
   - **Proposed Change:** Create templates for each type with appropriate fields:
     - Human Actor: Role, Goals, Access Level, Interaction Methods
     - System Actor: API Endpoint, Authentication, Protocol, SLA
     - Component: Interface, Dependencies, Responsibilities, State Management
   - **Rationale:** Structured documentation ensures all relevant information is captured
   - **Implementation Notes:** Add to templates/ directory

## 🎨 Examples & Comparisons
> 💡 *If helpful, provide examples of desired behavior or reference similar components that handle things well.*

### Desired Behaviour Example
```
## Actors

### Human Actors
- **Customer** 👤
  - Role: End user purchasing products
  - Interactions: Web UI, Mobile App
  
### System Actors  
- **Payment Gateway** 🔌
  - Type: External Service
  - Protocol: REST API
  - Authentication: OAuth 2.0

### Components
- **Order Service** ⚙️
  - Type: Internal Microservice
  - Responsibilities: Order processing, validation
  - Dependencies: Inventory Service, Payment Service
```

### Reference Implementation
- Component: UML notation standards
- Relevant Pattern: Clear visual and textual differentiation between actor types

## 🚀 Priority & Impact Assessment
> 💡 *Help prioritize this feedback by assessing its importance and impact.*

**Priority Level:** High
**Scope of Impact:** Framework-wide
**User Impact:** Improves clarity in all discovery and planning phases, reduces ambiguity in requirements
**Implementation Effort:** Moderate update

## 🔗 Related Feedback
> 💡 *Link to any related feedback documents or issues.*

- Related to general discovery phase improvements
- Connected to requirements clarity initiatives

## 📋 Meta Agent Assignment
> 💡 *Indicate which meta agent should process this feedback.*

**Recommended Meta Agent:** [[meta-prompt-engineer]]
**Reasoning:** This feedback relates to how prompts guide the discovery process and how information is structured, which falls under prompt engineering optimization

## 📝 Additional Notes
> 💡 *Any other context, considerations, or information that might be helpful.*

This differentiation would be particularly valuable in:
- Microservices architectures where services act as both components and system actors
- Security analysis where different actor types have different threat models
- API design where human vs system actors require different authentication/authorization approaches
- Testing strategies where different actor types require different test approaches

The framework would benefit from adopting industry-standard terminology and clear visual/textual indicators to differentiate between these entity types throughout all documentation and workflows.
